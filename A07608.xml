            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">M</seg>ANY years be now past, that ſome Religious of this holy houſe, eſpecially Lay-brothers whoſe exteriour occupations affoard them leſſe tyme to beſtow in reading bookes) requested m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> to write for them ſome co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendious Treatiſe; to guide them in their ſpirituall deuotions. Charity and deſire to ſerue, and help my Brethren, bound me
<pb facs="tcp:13110:6"/>(though I knew well my owne inſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency, and experience in ſpiritual affaires) to do my beſt to ſatisfy their importunity. Being therfore to begin, I thought it need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe to treate of Prayer, or of the Partes, Preparations, Conditions, and Directions that concerne the ſame, ſo many Trea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tiſes, ſome at large ſome more briefe, &amp; both very ſufficient hauing beene written of this Argument. Notwithſtanding I haue thought good to declare one point which I had a longe time wished I might ſee handled cleerly and diſtinctly: and the ſame, I knew to be the deſire alſo of many perſons that are deuoutly giuen to men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall prayer; to wit, VVhat meditation is, how the Powers of the Soule are to be vſed, and the acts of the Vnderſtanding, and the will directed to conſider thinges with fruite, and to exerciſe affections &amp; internall acts of Vertue. The which is a moſt excellent kind of Prayer, and of very great profit, principally for beginners,
<pb facs="tcp:13110:6"/>ſetting aſide ſupernatural kind of Prayer wherof we are not to ſpeake at this time.</p>
            <p>This point I intend to handle, and shall endeauour to do it with as much perſpicuity, distinction, and breuity as I may, making v<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e of what I haue read of this matter, in Saints works, and Authors of auncient and moderne tymes, and of what our Lord hath ſpecially giuen me to feel my ſelfe; yet with ſuch plainneſſe of ſtile, as the quality of the perſons, for whome it was written, requireth. For I neuer imagined that the Treatiſe it ſelfe should get out of the gates of our Mona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery.</p>
            <p>As it was written with my owne hand, I imparted it to my Brethren: and ſeing them much comforted and content therwith, I co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>municated the ſame to other deuout and ſpirituall perſons. By this meanes the Treatiſe was deliuered from hand to hand, many co<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ies therof being ſpread abroad; and (as it commonly fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth
<pb facs="tcp:13110:7"/>out) with the multitude of copies many errors and corruptions increaſed. For which reaſon; as alſo for that very many ſpirituall and intelligent perſons iudged it might be profitable, becauſe it declareth briefly and clearly the aforeſaid argument, ſo neceſſary and important; I permitted the ſame to be printed, that ſuch as would might make benefit therof, without the labour of copying it out.</p>
            <p>Neither haue I added or changed any thing, but let it paſſe as it was firſt di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uulged in writing with ſo great content and profit of the Readers: nor do I pretend any other thing, but only to aſſiſt thoſe who vſe the exerciſe of Prayer; to the end that ſome part of their deuotions may be deriued to my ſelfe, and the whole directed to the greater honour and glory of God Amen.</p>

In this very manner is meditation of ſpirituall things, that the Vnderſtanding conſidering one of the myſteries of our Faith, maketh diſcourſes vpon it, and conceites, of what it behooueth vs to loue, and what to hate; of what we muſt ſeeke to procure, and what to fly and take heed of, and the like. And this is

And therfore that it may be perfect Prayer, it is neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary, that togeather with the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes and conſiderations of the Vnderſtanding, the actes of the will do accompanie and follow, which muſt draw forth affectes and actes of vertues: and this is that which heere we deſire to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare.</p>

               <p n="4">4. The Meditation may be deuided into three points. The firſt is to conſider the ſtory of the myſterie whereof we are to medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate. The ſecond is to ponder the circumſtances which concurre in it. And the third, is to draw the fruite, and actes of vertues, which may be gathered out of them. But it is to be noted, that although here we put theſe three pointes di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct, and in their order; it muſt not be vnderſtood that in the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditation they go by this order, and diſtinction euery one by it ſelfe, but that they may be mingled and
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:13110:9"/>ioyned one with another. As for example, we beginning to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſider the ſtory of one myſtery, if there it happen that we conſider any circumſtance therof, or any ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous or deuout motion ſhall offer it ſelf; therin muſt we detayne our ſelues, and afterward paſſe to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thing. And if in the firſt word there occurre conſideratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s and do moue affects for the time prefixed for prayer, it is not neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to go any further, but to ſpend all the time in that. And the ſame I ſay, if one circumſtance ſuffice, or one affect, to ſpend all the time of prayer, be ſufficient; then it is not neceſſary to diſcourſe of the reſt. But theſe things are ſet down heere diſtinctly by themſelues eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one, that they may be vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood the better, and to giue ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient matter of meditation.</p>
               <p n="5">
                  <pb n="6" facs="tcp:13110:10"/> 5. The firſt point is to conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the ſtory of the myſtery lite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally and plainly as it happened, according as the holy Ghoſpell ſayth, or according to what may be read of that miſtery in good approued, and deuout bookes, or according to that which piouſly may be conſidered with good diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion, or laſtly according to that which was wont to happen in ſuch like caſes. As for example; if you conſider how our Sauiour was whipped at the pillar; you muſt imagine your ſelfe preſent in a Court or Auditory, where the Preſident, or Iudge is ſet in his Chayre, or Tribunall ſeate, and with him many principall men of authority, iudging one poore man, a very Saint and Innocent, and yet accuſed of grieuous offenſes, and great crymes, and the Iudge
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:13110:10"/>although he knoweth the accuſed to be guiltles, yet to condeſcend to the importunity of the accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſers, and to content them, he commandeth him to be whipped. And preſently ſome ſhameleſſe wretches, and cruell miniſters of Iuſtice take, and carry him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way with great ſpeed &amp; gladnes, command him to be ſtripped, and they to haſten him the more, help him forward, but very diſcourte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly; and in the meane tyme, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers prepare moſt cruell whipps and ſcourges with which they are to whippe him; and being naked, they ſpeake many ſhamefull and diſcourteous wordes vnto him, and they tye him very hard vnto a pillar of that Court, and begin to whippe him moſt furiouſly with all the force they had, all his body ouer, without any kind of pittie:
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:13110:11"/>and ſome ſouldiers being wearied, there come others with a freſh ſupply, with other kind of whip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pes, for the firſt were now halfe broken or worne out, and perhaps they vntie him, and turne his o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſide from the pillar, that no whole place may be found in all his body; and theſe alſo whippe him vntill they be weary, and for feare of not killing him (for they had no order for that) they leaue off and vnbind him: and how he with very great patience and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude, ſuffereth ſuch terrible, griefes and tormentes which all this while he felt, and then with great humility and mildnes, ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thereth vp his garments on the ground, and reſteth himſelfe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gayne, without once opening his ſacred mouth to complaine. And ſo in like manner you muſt
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:13110:11"/>conſider any other miſtery, as pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly we may belieue it fell out.</p>
               <p n="6">6. The ſecond point is to ponder with attention, the circu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, which are concerning that myſtery how it paſſed, as we haue ſaid of the Pillar, to ponder who is that Preſident which is there with ſuch authority; that he is but a poore miſerable man, a ſinner, an Idolatour, without knowledge of God, that to mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row he may die, and his body ſhal be conuerted into wormes meate, and his ſoule ſhall go to ſuffer e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall torments in Hell with the Diuells. And who is he that is accuſed, who is he that is ſo tyed with ſo great humility, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect: that he is Ieſus Chriſt God &amp; Man; according to his Diuinity he is Creatour of al things; whom all creatures ſerue and adore: and
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:13110:12"/>according to his Humanity, he is a perſon of ſo great authority a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the people, who wrought ſo many miracles, and made ſo many Sermons, that euery one thought himſelfe happy, that could touch his garment. What would he thinke to ſee himſelfe ſo abuſed againſt Iuſtice, &amp; to ſee himſelfe deliuered into the hands of ſuch vile and cruell miniſters. And when ſuch a perſon, ſo vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable and chaſt, ſhould be ſtripped before ſo many people, how great the griefe would be which he felt in ſo delicate a body, being whipped ſo vnreaſonably by ſuch cruell and vnmerciful ſlaues: And many other ſuch like circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces which heere paſſed, as in all the reſt you muſt proceed, ponde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of them with particuler con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration.</p>

               <p>THE circumſtances which generally may be conſidered in the myſteries of our Sauiour Ieſus Chriſt, eſpecially in his holy Paſſion are theſe, <hi>VVho? VVhat? For whome? For what? Of whome? How?</hi> and the declaration is that which followeth.</p>

                  <head>§. I. VVHO.</head>
                  <p n="2">2. The firſt circumſtance is, to conſider attentiuely, <hi>VVho</hi> is the perſon that doth that worke, or ſuffer that payne: that it is Ieſus Chriſt God and man, who being God from all Eternity, without any beginning of his Being, for
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:13110:13"/>the ſaluation of the world came downe from heauen, and was made man in the wombe of the ſacred Virgin Mary.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. And in as much, as he is God, he is the Word of his eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall Father, ſecond Perſon of the Bleſſed Trinity; and as eternall, as great as God, as powerfull as the Father and the holy Ghoſt, and finally one and the ſame God, &amp; one and the ſame Eſſence with the Father, and the Holy Ghoſt; who created all thinges, and doth conſerue, and gouerne them, and whome all they ſerue, and praiſe; and the praiſe which they giue to him, and thoſe which all creaturers can giue, do not come neere by an infinite diſtance to that which he deſerueth, in praiſe ſeruice, and loue. And al creaturs togeather in his compariſon are
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:13110:13"/>not an Ant before him, nor ſo much as a ſand of the ſea, in whoſe preſence the higheſt Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raphims tremble and feare, as alſo all the reſt of the Bleſſed Spirits.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. As he is man, he is King, and vniuerſall Lord of all that is created, becauſe his eternal Father hath put all into his hands, and all creatures ought to obay him, and be ſubiect vnto him, and by right and authority he may do wrea them as it pleaſeth him, not only with natural but alſo ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naturall things. That he impar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth al the good included in grace and glory to whome he pleaſeth. And all the Angells, and ſotiles in heauen, and they who are to go thither muſt come into glory by his helping hand and by his me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits. And that his moſt holy Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:13110:14"/>only is more worth and more eſteemed, and beloued of Almighty God, &amp; hath receaued more riches, and gifts from God, then all creatures togeather, with ſuch and ſo great exceſſe, that there is no compariſon.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. That his holy body, is for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, by the worke of the holy Ghoſt, of the pureſt bloud of a Virgin, the moſt holy that euer was, or ſhall be; and therefore hath greater beauty and perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of nature then euer any hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane creature had, or ſhall haue; and alſo more deli<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p n="6">6. And that his ſoule being moſt holy from the inſtant of his
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:13110:14"/>conception, is full of grace and charity, and full of al vertues and giftes of the holy Ghoſt; and that in ſo high a degree, that it excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth, without compariſon, the graces and vertues of all Angels, and men that euer were, are, or ſhal be. And that not only for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe he hath grace, but alſo to communicate, as head, to the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels and men already created, &amp; infinite others who might be cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated; for all the grace they haue receaued, and ſhall receaue heere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after, all do receaue it from the fulneſſe and copious abundance of the grace of Chriſt.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. And alſo from the inſtant of his conception, that moſt holy Soule of his, is full of ſo mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uailous ſcience, and wiſdome, that he knoweth, &amp; can tel perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctly the natures and eſſence of all
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:13110:15"/>things, which are, were, and are to come, and the number and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of them all, and euery one in particuler &amp; diſtinctly; he know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth their properties, conditions, qualities, and inclinations; he knoweth how many ſtarres be in heauen, and how euery one is called, and how bigge enery one is; and how many drops of water there be in the ſea, &amp; how many ſands. He knoweth and can tell all the thoughts and deſires of men and Angels, good and bad, as well thoſe that now they haue, as thoſe which they ſhal haue for euer: all theſe he ſees and knowes more clearly, and diſtinctly then I can ſee that which I haue before myne eyes.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. And aboue all from the ſaid inſtant of his conception, his ſoule is full of glory, for from that
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:13110:15"/>tyme he ſaw moſt clearly the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine Eſſence of God, and did in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioy it moſt perfectly: and all this glory and beauty, this our Lord would of his owne proper will and deſire haue to lie hidden, and as it were kept there in the chie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt part of his ſoule, and for 33 yeares did defraud his moſt holy body of all this glory which na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally was due vnto it, that ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by he might ſuffer labours and paynes for vs. And that in the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour part of his ſoule he might ſuffer ſorrow, griefe, and the like as he did very much, &amp; he would not vſe power and authority which he had ouer all things, nor his maieſty proper to his perſon, but be borne and liue in pouerty and deſpect, ſubiect vnto ſo many labours, and ſo great wearines as he ſuffered in the ſame manner, as
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:13110:16"/>if he had beene a poore ſinner.</p>
                  <p n="9">9. And beſides all that is ſaid, euen in this very ſame pouerty, &amp; humility which he choſe, you muſt conſider the dignity of that moſt ſacred Humanity, that ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of working miracles, that he co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>manded the diuels as his ſlaues, and they obayed him and feared him; only with a voice he reui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued the dead, with the touch of his hands he cured al infirmities; the great authority that he had amongſt the people, that he was held for a great Prophet, as ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer the like was ſeene in Iſrael; that the Citties were emptied &amp; great multitudes went after him into the deſert, only to heare his doctrine, and held themſelues happy who could come ſo neere, as to kiſſe the hemme of his gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, for only the touch of it cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:13110:16"/>all diſeaſes. And being his authority was ſo great on the one ſide, yet his humility one the other ſide was profound, ſuch his plainneſſe, ſweetnes, &amp; affability which he vſed to thoſe with whome he conuerſed, and the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cility and charity wherwith he did remedie their infirmities and neceſſities, and many times not being called, nor inuited, that with this he won the hartes, and gayned the good will of all.</p>

THE third circumſtance is to conſider, <hi>For VVhome</hi> our Sauiour ſuffered all this, for if he had ſuffered it for one who had deſerued it, and would haue beene thankfull for it, it would not haue beene a thing ſo much to be admyred, or if he had ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red it for perſons of great account and dignity, as for Angels, or S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <item>1. THE fourth circumſtance is to conſider <hi>For VVhy;</hi> that is, for what cauſe our Sauour ſuffered all this. The Preſident who gaue the ſentence, after he had very well examined his cauſe
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:13110:23"/>did affirme thrice, that he found no cauſe at al either to condemne him, or giue him any puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: and indeed it was ſo, that he had not any fault, for he was moſt innocent, not knowing what ſinne was, neuer did harme to any, but good to all: ſo that the cauſe being well examined, it is found that there was no other of his part, but his bounty and mercy, and thoſe bowels of infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite charity, with which he tooke compaſſion of the miſery of men, who were all condemned to eternall death, and had no poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibility to be deliuered from this ſentence.

This is the cauſe which was of his part, for which he ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered, to wit, his bounty, his mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, his charity and loue: but of our part there were our ſinnes, the cauſe of his ſuffering.

                  <list>
                     <item>1. Firſt, that he ſuffered of his owne Choſen and Elected people, of whome he in parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular was Lord and King; to whome he had been promiſed ſo many yeares ſince; whome he brought out of Captiuity of <hi>Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt</hi> with ſo great myracles, and prodigious wonders; to whome himſelfe gaue the Law written with his finger; whom he ſuſtay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned fourtie yeares with bread

                     <item>2. The ſeçond: that he ſuffered of them, to whome he had done ſo great good, and giuen ſo many benefits, rayſing their dead, deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uering their poſſeſſed, during their diſeaſed, and conuerſing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongeſt them, with ſuch loue and beneuolence.</item>
                     <item>3. The third: that he ſuffered of his cruell enemyes, who for the ſpace of two yeares had ſought his life, and to diſhonour him, &amp; would haue drunke his bloud, ſo great was their hatred and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtation towards him; and to theſe he co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mitted himſelfe wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly, to the end they might vſe
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:13110:25"/>him at their pleaſure.</item>
                     <item>4. The fourth: that he ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red of moſt vile &amp; baſe Vaſſales, of no account at all, without any ſhame, meaſure, or any other reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect; for doubtles they who did torment him, were the publike executioners, who were wont to puniſh the malefactors; if it be not, that perhaps the Chiefe Prieſts did commit this to ſome baſe ſeruants of their owne, that they might torment him with the more cruelty. Of him, that gaue him the buffet, ſaith S. <hi>Iohn</hi> the Euangeliſt, that he was a ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uant of the High Prieſt; and ſo we may thinke others were alſo who tormented him. But how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer, wee ſee they were baſe fellowes and ſlaues, very poore and abiect, for they parted his poore garments in foure parts a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:13110:26"/>them.</item>
                     <item>5. The fifth; that our Bleſſed Sauiour ſuffered of all kind of people, Gentiles, and Iewes, of great and ſmall, of the principall, &amp; of the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon ſort, all it ſemeth concurred againſt him; and thoſe who ſix dayes before had done him ſo great honour, receiuing him with palmes, and crying out that he was <hi>King of Iſraël;</hi> now they perſwade themſelues, that all his myracles were deuiſes &amp; craftes, and that he pretended to vſurpe the Kingdome, and now they deſire to haue him crucified, and that the thiefe and homicide <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rabbas</hi> ſhould be ſet free.</item>
                     <item>6. The ſixt; that he ſuffered of his owne Diſciples, which was not the leaſt of his payne, to ſee, that the Diſciple whome he had taught ſo long, and brought
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:13110:26"/>vp vnder his wing, and done him ſo many good turnes, ſhould ſell him, &amp; betray him to his enemies: and another Diſciple whome he had honoured about the reſt, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king him Head of the Church, that he ſhould deny him publick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly with an oath; and that all the reſt ſhould forſake him and runne away, leauing him in the hands of his enemies. And finally he ſuffered euen of his owne mother, for although the moſt Bleſſed Virgin <hi>Mary</hi> had no fault at all, but very great merit, in being preſent at the paſſion of her ſonne; yet with her preſence ſhe did in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe greatly his griefe &amp; payne, in ſo much that he would haue ſuffered them double, not to haue ſeene that which his mother ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered: and notwithſtanding he would paſſe all this, that our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:13110:27"/>might be more copi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, although ſo greatly to his coſt, and coſt of his moſt Bleſſed Mother.</item>

                  <p>THE ſixt circumſtance is, <hi>How</hi> he ſuffered; in the which there be three poynts to be conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered.</p>
                  <list>
                     <item>1. The firſt: that he ſuffered with exceding great charity; in ſo much that although the works he wrought were ſo excellent and great, and ſo exceſſiue the paynes he ſuffered; yet we muſt rather ponder the manner how he ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red them, then what he ſuffered. For how much ſoeuer it was he ſuffered, far greater was his cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity by the which he was prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to ſuffer much more, if it had been neceſſary for vs. And this is a circumſtance which ought to
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:13110:27"/>be very well conſidered.</item>
                     <item>2. The ſecond poynt is, that our Lord ſuffered without any kind of caſe or comfort, either of heauen or earth, which neuer fell out ſo to the Martyrs, and others who haue ſuffered for his ſake; that how much the greater the torments were, and the paynes they ſuffered, ſo much the greater was the comfort which from heauen was giuen them, that the greateſt torments &amp; paynes were conuerted into recreation and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour. But our Sauiour, that his payns might be the greater, would willingly be forſaken of his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and of all comfort and eaſe that might mitigate his torments, as himſelf ſignified when he ſaid: <hi>My God, my God, why haſt thou for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaken me?</hi>
                     </item>
                     <item>3. The third point, is to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:13110:28"/>the manner that our Saui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our had, in that which he did, and ſuffered; that is, the vertues which he exerciſed in all his actions; for if they be conſidered with attention, in them we ſhall find moſt excellent examples of al kind of vertue, and principally moſt profound humility, that ſo great a Lord would be ſo deſpiſed and abaſed; his patience ſo admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable amongſt ſo many abuſes, &amp; iniuries; his meeknes, in not contradicting any one, nor de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fending himſelfe, but ſuffer him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe to be carried, drawne, and done with whatſoeuer they would, like vnto a lambe; his ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, which made the Iudge himſelfe to admire, that amongſt ſo many and ſo falſe calumnia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions he anſwered not one only word; his moſt perfect obedience
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:13110:28"/>by which he fulfilled whatſoeuer his Father had ordayned, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though it was ſo hard and diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culte to fulfill, as to ſuffer death vpon the Croſſe; his fortitude, by which he offered himſelfe into the handes of his enemies, and ſuffered ſo many torments with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out euer co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>playning, or deſiring them to take pitty, or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion on him; his perſeuerance, by which he brought to an end the worke of our redemption, although they ſayd if he would come down from the Croſſe they would beleeue in him: but his charity, is that which moſt doth ſhine heere, for he ſuffered not only for his friends, but alſo for his enimies; and his mercy, by which he tooke vpon him all the penalties of man, and their miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, to ſet them free from them,
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:13110:29"/>and abhorring ſinne ſo much, he would take vpon him all the ſins of the world, that men might be freed from them; his true deſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of the world, and the proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities and fauours therof; and his rigorous auſterity of life, with voluntary pouerty: and finally all vertues haue moſt perfect examples in the life, and Paſſion of our Sauiour.</item>
                     <item>4. All this pertayneth to the manner how our Sauiour did, and ſuffered all theſe things: and theſe be the ſix principal circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, which we muſt conſider in all his works. To the which may be added other two, that are of the Time, &amp; Place wherin he ſuffered.</item>
                     <item>5. The ſeauenth circumſtance is to conſider, <hi>VVhere</hi> our Lord ſuffered, to wi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>

<pb n="47" facs="tcp:13110:29"/>of the moſt populous Citties of the world, that his floutinges might be more publike; und the Citty very Religious and Holy, where Iuſtice and Truth ſhould haue preuailed more; and the people vnto whome he had beene moſt beneficiall; where he had wrought ſo many miracles, and preached ſo many Sermons; and finally he ſuffered on the Mount <hi>Caluary,</hi> which was an infamous and publike place, where male<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factours were put to death.</item>
                     <item>6. The eight circumſtance, ſhall be to conſider <hi>VVhen</hi> he did ſuffer, to wit, at Eaſter, the moſt ſolemne feaſt that the Iewes had amongſt them; when people of al the world were come thither to celebrate the Paſchal feaſt, who might carry backe newes how they had ſeene him die; and in the
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:13110:30"/>time when euery one was buſied in feaſting and ioy. And ſo we may conſider that our Sauiour being put vpon the Croſſe, euery one departed very well content vnto their houſe, eſpecially the High Prieſts and Princes of the people, who doubtles inuited one another &amp; feaſted with great ioy, that they had fulfilled their deſire. And at the time whileſt euery one is thus imployed, our Sauiour ſuffered on the Croſſe ſuch cruel griefs and dolorous torments.</item>
                     <item>7. Theſe be the circumſtances which generally may be conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in all the myſteries of Chriſt our Lord, beſides other in parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culer which occurre to euery one. But note, that although all theſe be put downe heere in this order, yet it is not neceſſary to ponder them all in euery myſterie, but
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:13110:30"/>thoſe which are moſt to the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe of what is meditated; or thoſe to which their deuotion doth moſt incline them, and the particuler affect of him that pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth doth moſt draw him vnto.</item>
                     <item>8. But it will be of great im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance to haue them all well conſidered, and the poynts they contayne very well printed in the memory, that whilſt he me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditateth anything of thoſe which our Sauiour did, or ſuffered, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently with facility, and without diuerting himſelfe from his me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditation, he may conſider who is the perſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> which doth or ſuffereth that, and what affect he had in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly in his ſoule when he did that worke exteriorly, and what moued him to do it, and the reſt of what we haue ſayd before.</item>

                     <item>2. The motiues vnto this af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, are almoſt the ſame circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances which we touched aboue but eſpecially the two firſt, for that which is wont to moue vs much to compaſſion, is to ſee that he who ſuffereth, or is put to any great plunge, is a perſon of No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility, ſome principall man, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licate and innocent, and ſuffereth without any fault: and that the paynes be great, and that he ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fereth them for out ſake: and all theſe conſiderations haue great place in the myſteryes of Chriſt our Sauiour, as may appeare by the circumſtances ſpoken of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. And ſo that which we ought to haue compaſſion of, is, to ſee ſo Noble a Perſon, ſo Venerable, ſo delicate, ſo worthy to be ſerued,
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:13110:33"/>and reuerenced of all creatures, to paſſe through ſo many troubles all the dayes of his life, in ſo great pouerty, and diſcomodity of all temporall things, the heat, the cold, the hunger and thirſt, the wearines, the wayes, and many other things of which his life is full. And principally the great and greiuous torments of his Paſſion, not only the exteriour: but much more the interiour, as it is ſaid in the ſecond circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance.</item>
                     <item>3. For if it be of great merit for vs, to take compaſſion vpon any of our neighbours which we ſee caſt into miſery: how much more will it be to take compaſſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of all the labours and paynes of our Sauiour? And therfore it hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peth much, for this affect to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider that we ſe our father or bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:13110:33"/>to ſuffer thoſe miſeries, and labours, or els ſome other perſon whome we loue much. For verily Chriſt is more then father and brother; for our father, brother, &amp; friends do not loue in ſo much as he doth, nor haue done ſo much for vs, as he hath done; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther owe we ſo much vnto them, as we do to him.</item>
                     <item>4. Finally this affect of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion dependeth and followeth naturally the conſideration of the circumſtances aboue ſaid; and therfore about the ſame there is no more neceſſary to be ſpoken, but only to aduertiſe, that the Compaſſion which we ought to haue of Chriſt our Sauiour muſt not be as a naturall affect, as we ſhould take compaſſion of a perſon which we ſhould ſee dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen to ſome great extremity, or
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:13110:34"/>calamity againſt, his will: for in this ſort he commanded the daughters of <hi>Hieruſulem</hi> that they ſhould not weepe for him, when he carried his Croſſe vpon his backe: but it muſt be as an affect of Faith, conſidering that a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon who deſerued to be reueren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced and ſerued of all creatures, would of his owne proper will ſubiect himſelfe to ſuffer ſo many labours, and paynes to deliuer me from them, and from eternall tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments which I had deſerued: and this is the affect of Compaſſion, the dore, or gate to all the reſt.</item>

                     <item>1. THE affect of Contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is an inward dete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtation of ſinne, great ſorrow for hauing offended All mighty God,
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:13110:34"/>and a firme purpoſe to ſinne no more. And for this it is a great motiue to know the malice and turpitude that a ſinne conteyneth in it ſelfe, the which no way is knowne better, then by ſeeing what Chriſt ſuffered to deſtroy the ſaid ſinne; for by the payne we diſcouer the greatnes of the fault.</item>
                     <item>2. If we ſhould ſee ſome prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall Noble man, &amp; much eſtee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med of the King to be drawne by ſentence of Iuſtice, to be pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blickly whipped, and laſtly to be put vpon the Gallouſe like a baſe ſlaue or thief; certainly we ſhould vnderſtand that the fault he had committed was very great: and if this who was ſo put to death ſhould be the Prince himſelfe, Heyre to the Kingdome, and knowing that his Father had no
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:13110:35"/>other child, &amp; that he loued him much; and being a iuſt and pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent man commanded him to be put to death in that manner; we ſhould be certaynly perſwaded, that the ſinne he had committed was very grieuous. And much more if we knew the Prince him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe had not committed it, but ſome ſeruant of his, and for only being his ſurety, and offering to pay for him; yet all this to be done vnto him, it would make vs maruel more that there ſhould be a fault in the world that deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued ſuch chaſtiſment.</item>
                     <item>3. Therfore in this manner we muſt excerciſe this affect whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> we conſider Chriſt our Sauiour in any paſſage of his life, or paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, to ſee that he is the only be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten Sonne of God, naturall Heyre of all the goods of Glory,
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:13110:35"/>and that thirty three yeares he was in baniſhment in this miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable valley of Teares, ſuffering ſo many labours, and afflictions; and finally that his owne Father who loued him as himſelfe, deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uereth him vp into the hands of cruell tormenters, who whippe him ſo cruelly, put on his head a Crowne of thornes, giue him ſo many buffets, vſe him with ſuch ſcorne and mockery, carry him with publike cryes through the ſtreets, and crucifie him, as if he had beene the greateſt and moſt vile malefactour in the world; &amp; yet of his owne part he had co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted no fault at al, but ſuffereth it only becauſe he offered to pay for the ſinnes of men. By this we ſhall know how grieuous a thing ſinne is, and how much God ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horreth it; for that to deſtroy it he
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:13110:36"/>choſe to ſuffer ſo great torments, and if it were needfull would ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer them againe to excuſe one of vs only. And preſently to caſt our eyes vpon our ſelues, and conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der how many we haue commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, to conceiue great hatred of them all, and great anger with our ſelues, for hauing done them.</item>
                     <item>4. If we ſhould ſee our Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, or Brother whome we loue very tenderly, dead before our eyes, al the body ſtabbed through, and ſhould know who it was that had ſo ſlayne him by Treaſon, how angry ſhould we be with him? Thus when we ſee our Saui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our taken priſoner, and vſed ſo ill, whipped &amp; nayled on the Croſſe; we muſt conſider that we be there preſent amongſt thoſe villaines, and that our ſinnes be they who ſo abuſe him, and take away his
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:13110:36"/>life: and let vs beleeue without all doubt that theſe gaue him more payne then the whipping, nayling, and all the reſt of the torments: that we may be very ſorry and weep hartily, for ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing ſo offended him, &amp; increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed his paynes and griefs: and let vs make very firme purpoſes, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer more to offend him for all the world.</item>

The ſecond poynt is, to giue him thankes againe; that is, with word and hart for the benefit be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed vpon him, and in all oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations he muſt confeſſe it, and prayſe it. The third; to recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence by works, according to his ability the benefit receiued.</item>
                     <item>2. This affect is excerciſed in pondering any of the myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryes of Chriſt our Lord, the great
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:13110:37"/>benefit he hath done vnto vs: for by the ſinne of our firſt parents, and for our owne proper ſinnes, we were by iuſt ſentence con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned to eternall payne of hell, and baniſhed for euer from glory, and giuen vp into the power of the Diuell: and all the creatures in the world together were not ſufficient to deliuer vs from him, but only the Sonne of God. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther was there any other remedy (ſuppoſing the diuine ordination of God) but his Incarnation, Death, and Paſſion. Wherefore by euery paſſage of his life, and by euery action of his, wee are deliuered from ſinne, from the Diuell, from death eternall, from the paynes of hell, and from the ſubiection and Tyrany of all our enemies; and by the ſame we are reſtored to the grace and friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:13110:38"/>of God, and to be adopted children of his, and all the graces and gifts of the holy Ghoſt are giuen vnto vs, and the title to get the Kingdome of heauen, and to be members of Chriſt, and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticipate of all his merits. All theſe benefits muſt be pondered very particulerly, in euery myſtery of Chriſt, for euery one by it ſelfe, and euery motion of him, was ſufficient to gaine vs all this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit; but that his Maieſty would by reaſon of the aboundance of his charity, that our Redemption might be more copious, offer all his life, death, and paſſion, as a totall price of our Redemption.</item>
                     <item>3. And heer muſt be ponde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red (beſides the greatnes of the benefit) theſe foure points. The firſt, Who is he that doth it, to wit, the Sonne of God himſelfe,
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:13110:38"/>who troubleth no creature to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deeme and deliuer vs, but him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe in perſon would do it. The ſecond, that he beſtowed theſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits of vs, greatly to his owne coſt, ſuffering ſo much for vs. The third, the loue wherwith he did it, and the deſire of our ſalua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and the mind prepared to do much more, if it had beene ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary for vs. The fourth, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider euery one of theſe benefits, as if they had beene done only to thy ſelfe. And this is as much as toucheth the firſt point, which is to acknowledge, and eſteeme the benefit, and be mindfull of it.</item>
                     <item>4. The ſecond point muſt be to giue tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ks to God very hartily for all he hath done, and ſuffered for vs, and for euery paſſage of his life; acknowledging that if all our members ſhould be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerted
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:13110:39"/>into tongues, and harts, &amp; ſhould prayſe him, we ſhould not anſwere to the leaſt droppe of bloud, which he ſhedde for vs, nor to the leaſt of his labours which he ſuffered: nor if we ſhould prayſe him, as much as all the Angels, and men, and all crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, yet we ſhould come very ſhort. And therfore we muſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire very hartily, that all, both heauen and earth will help vs to prayſe him, &amp; we ought to inuite them to it, eſpecially our Angell-Keeper, and the Saints to whome we are moſt deuoted.</item>
                     <item>5. The third point is, to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere with workes to the bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit receaued, how great in grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude would it be if to any perſon, of whome we haue receaued great benefits, we might do ſome little ſeruice, &amp; would not do it;
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:13110:39"/>and ſo thou muſt make firme pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes to do whatſoeuer thou doſt vnderſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d to be pleaſing to Chriſt our Lord, and thou muſt be very ſory that thou haſt not done ſo al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready, and theſe purpoſes muſt be very free from any intereſt: for although he were to giue thee no reward at all, it is ſufficient that it is ſo due vnto him, and that he hath ſo much deſcrued it, to ſhew thy ſelfe gratefull.</item>
                     <item>6. Beſides theſe three points, remember to be thankeful to God the Father, and all the Bleſſed Trinity, for all the benefits be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed vpon the Humanity of Chriſt, as it is reaſon that the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren be gratefull for the benefits done vnto their Father, as if they were done to themſelues; and the members muſt be thankefull for the benefits done to the Head eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially;
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:13110:40"/>for all the benefits and graces which were in Chriſt; did turne to our profit, for he made vs participate of them all.</item>

                  <p>ADMIRATION is cauſed at the ſight of a thing that is rare, extraordinary, and mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uailous. For ſeeing it, and not knowing the cauſe of it, a man remayneth aſtoniſhed &amp; deſirous to know it; the which in nothing in the world hath place more, then in the diuine myſteries. For all of them be in themſelues very meruailous: therfore the Prophet Eſay ſaith; that Chriſt ſhould be called <hi>Admirable,</hi> becauſe all things in him were ſo very great: and if they do not cauſe admiration in vs, it is becauſe, though we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lecue
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:13110:40"/>them by faith, yet we do not co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſider them with attention. And heerof it proceedeth, that when with moſt attention we conſider them, they ſeeme new vnto vs, as if we had not knowne them before, and then they cauſe admiration in vs; &amp; ſo much the more, by how much we do con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider them with attention.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. And heere vpon it co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth to paſſe alſo, that they who are very contemplatiue, and whome our Saniour doth illuminate, with particuler light in their ſoules, to ſee the diuine myſteries, of pure admiration they remayne abſorpt, and ſo eleuated, that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny tymes they remayne without their ſenſes; &amp; ſo this affect is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to prayer, for euery thing con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered in it, is worthy to cauſe ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: as to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſider the greatnes
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:13110:41"/>of God, his maieſty, his power, his wiſdome, his iuſtice, his mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy and the reſt of his attributes, and perfections.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. But particulerly in the holy myſteries of Chriſt our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour, that which muſt cauſe ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration, is to conſider thoſe ine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimable riches of Charity with which God loued men, who ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing one only So<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ne which was al his delight, and not hauing, nor being poſſible that he ſhould haue any other, gaue him for our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy, &amp; conſented that he ſhould ſuffer ſo many labours, and tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and giue his life for them, and that the Sonne himſelf loued them ſo much that he would haue offered himſelfe with a very good will to haue ſuffered all that he ſuffered; for he eſteemeth men ſo much, that the whole B. Trini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:13110:41"/>imploy themſelues for their remedy. God the Father ſendeth his ſonne, the Sonne maketh him ſelfe man, &amp; ſuffereth &amp; dieth for them. The Holy Ghoſt worketh the myſtery of the Incarnation.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Admire alſo much to ſee the wiſdome of God who could find ſuch an inuention, and reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy for men: for when all the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels ſhould put themſelues to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider the conueniences of it, they would neuer ceaſe to wonder. And euery paſſage of the life, and Paſſion of Chriſt, and all that he hath done for man, haue ſo many things worthy of admiration, that it is not poſſible to reduce them to a ſumme, but leaue it to that which euery one findeth by experience, hauing conſidered them with attention.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. It cauſeth alſo admiration
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:13110:42"/>to ſee the blindnes of the world and the ingratitude that the Son of God comming to help it, it would not receaue him, but laid handes on him, euen vntill it killed him. The hardnes of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, who after they haue fayth and knowledg of theſe myſteries they are ſo litle gratefull for them, and profit themſelues ſo litle by them.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. The excellency of the glory of heauen, that God would ſuffer ſo much to gaine it for men. The grieuouſnes of ſin, that God did ſo much to diſtroy it. The rigour of iuſtice, ſince ſo he puniſhed his owne ſonne for others ſinnes and offences. The greatnes of his mercy, for leaſt men ſhould periſh he tooke their ſinnes vpon him. The ſharpnes of the payne of hell, for to deliuer man from all this
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:13110:42"/>the ſonne of God ſuffered. Theſe and an innumerable company of others, are things which do cauſe admiration in the conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the myſteries of Chriſt.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. And the manner of excer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſing this affect is this: when the ſoule conſidereth theſe or ſuch like things worthy of conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, after he hath pondered as well as he can the reaſons of the myſteryes, to cauſe admiration, let him looke as one aſtomiſhed to ſee ſo meruailous a thing: And deſire to haue more light, and cleare knowledge of it, to prayſe &amp; loue our Lord more worthily, who would worke ſuch things, and to cry out with the Prophet ſaying: O Lord, I haue heard thy words, and was aſtoniſhed, and in a maze: O Lord my God, how meruailous is thy name in all the

                  <p>IOY and ſpirituall guſt, is of great importance to conſerue the ſpirit and perſeuere in vertue: as alſo on the contrary, a great inconueniency, &amp; trouble in ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, is too much ſorrow and inor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinate griefe, eſpecially that which groweth of temporall reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pects: and alſo the vayne, &amp; too much ioy which is taken in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall things, is hurtfull to the ſpirit very much, for it diſtracteth it, and draweth it to externall things, and is cauſe of laughter, and idle words, ieſts, curioſityes, playes, and ſuch like things.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Againſt al this is the holy
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:13110:43"/>affect of ioy, &amp; ſpirituall delight: and for this Saintes haue com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended much that Religious per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, and ſpirituall men ſhould procure to acuſtome themſelues, to carry great ioy, and ſpirituall guſt in their ſoules, which maketh a man more compoſed and more modeſt in the exteriour, and more recollected in the interiour, and maketh him deſpiſe all the ioy of temporall things, and endeauour to do exerciſes of pennance, and mortification, and caſteth out from his ſoule all idlenes &amp; ſloth, which commeth of vicious ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row and griefe, and doth many other great profits.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. For this affect of ſpirituall ioy is to be exerciſed in the my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteries of Chriſt in this manner; firſt, in thoſe myſteries which haue in themſelues any ioy, or
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:13110:44"/>proſperity to reioyce and be glad at his content and all his glory: as if a man ſhould ſee ſome proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous &amp; fortunate thing happen to his Father, or Brother, or other perſon which he much eſteemed, as it is ſayd in the Ghoſpell of thoſe perſons, who with good &amp; ſincere intention followed and heard our Sauiour his doctrine, that they reioyed, and were glad at al thoſe things which they ſaw him do with glory and honour.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. So the ſoule muſt reioyce with Chriſt himſelfe, to ſee the feaſt the Angels make at his Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uity, how the Sheepheards come to adore him, and alſo the Kings how they do prayſe him and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rify him: and how S. <hi>Simeon,</hi> &amp; S. <hi>Anne</hi> do publiſh his greatnes; af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward how the Doctors admire in the Temple at his doctrine: In
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:13110:44"/>his Baptiſme how his eternall Father did honour and authorize him: in the deſert how he ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commeth the Diuel, and how the Angels ſerue him: and in all the tyme of his preaching, how the people honoured him, how the Diuells obayed him: the power and authority wherewith he wrought ſo many miracles, the maieſty wherwith they receiued him on Palmes ſunday: and final<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in all the paſſages of his life, yea and in thoſe of his paſſion, as often, as any honourable thing ſhall happen vnto him, of autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity or proſperity, the ſoule muſt be glad and ioyfull of it: becauſe it is done vnto our redeemer, or of the content and pleaſure he receiueth by it.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Alſo in the ſorrowfull things, troubleſome and paynefull
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:13110:45"/>although conſidered according to the paines, griefs, deſpects, and aduerſities which our Sauiour ſuffered, they muſt cauſe ſorrow in vs and paſſion, as we ſaid in the firſt affect: but on the other ſide, and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſidered in another manner they muſt cauſe vs great Spiritual ioy for the reſpects following.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. Firſt, conſidering the glory of God which from thence ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth, more then any other works done in the world, and that they were the moſt gratefull ſeruices euer done, or ſhalbe done heere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after, and in which are manife<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted his power, his wiſdome, his bounty, iuſtice, mercy, and the reſt of his perfections: and this is a title very ſufficient for a ſoule that loueth God, to reioyce and be glad.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. Secondly, for the glory of
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:13110:45"/>the Humanity of Chriſt, who in all the paſſages of his life, gaue moſt excellent demonſtraction of his vertue: and therfore it is great reaſon, that a ſoule receaue great ſpirituall ioy, to ſee their redee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer with that fortitude of mind to ouercome all thoſe torments, with that inuincible patience to withſtand all the cruelty of his enemies, and their malice; to ſee that order, modeſty, and grauity amongeſt ſo many mocks, and ſcornes; that wiſedome in anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring ſo many demands and ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumniations; that power he ſhewed when he would, throw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing downe his enemies with one only word, and not conſenting that they ſhould ſo much as hurt any of his diſciples; that benigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and vnſpeakable charity in praying for thoſe who tormen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:13110:46"/>him, and in healing the care of him that came to take him.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. Of al theſe things and many ſuch like, it is iuſt, and fit that the ſoule reioyce ſpiritually, to ſee their Redemer, how glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly he proceedeth in all things; as it would be iuſt, that a ſouldiar ſhould reioyce to ſee his Captaine fight valourouſly againſt his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, and to ſee him alſo weary himſelfe, and labour much: and although for this cauſe he ſhould take pitty of him, yet on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therſide he would reioyce much, if he ſaw him ouercome his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, and deſtroy them, and put them to flight: eſpecially if he knew, that of ſuch labour would follow great honour and glory for himſelfe, and alſo much profit for his ſouldiars. Euen ſo a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian muſt reioyce, to ſee that all
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:13110:46"/>thoſe labours are to redound to the more glory of Chriſt, &amp; that for them his eternall Father will giue the greateſt honour and au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority that can be imagined, as S. Paul ſaith: He humbled him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe being made obedient, euen vntill the death of the Croſſe, for the which God hath exalted him and giuen him a Name, aboue all Names, that in the Name of IESVS euery knee ſhould bow, in heauen, earth, and hell, and all tongues ſhould confeſſe, &amp; prayſe him.</p>
                  <p n="9">9. Thirdly, ioy muſt be ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered out of theſe myſteries of the paſſion, ſo the great good, and profit that therby cometh vnto al mankind, for by theſe the debts of our ſins are paid, which none els could pay. Furthermore we are redeemed from the ſeruitude
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:13110:47"/>of the Diuell, and from the tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of vices and paſſions, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuered from eternall condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and right is giuen vs to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine to eternall glory, and a title of Sonnes of God, &amp; brethren of Chriſt. By theſe our Sacraments were merited, and ſuccour, with examples, was giuen vnto vs, doctrine of all vertue, medicines for all our infirmities, and a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall remedy for all our euils: all theſe be motiues to receaue great ioy and ſpirituall comfort, ſeeing that Chriſt our Lord, although ſo much to his coſt, and with ſo great labour, he ſo copiouſly wrought our redemption.</p>

                  <p>LOVE includeth in it ſelfe and conſiſteth of three acts. The firſt is to be glod of all the goods of the perſon that he loueth. The ſecond to deſire that he may haue many more that he hath not. The third is to do for him all that poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly we can. For as S. <hi>Gregory</hi> ſaith, the proofe of loue are the
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:13110:48"/>workes. And when the loue is very perfect and inflamed, the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther effect which is to conforme vs in all things with the perſon we loue, followeth; to wit, to loue what he loueth, and hate what he hateth, and receiue con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent in all things with him. By theſe poyntes, the loue of God muſt be exerciſed: the firſt to re<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ceiue great content and pleaſure that God be who he is, and hath al the good he hath; that he be ſo great, ſo infinite, ſo powerfull, ſo wiſe, and the like of all the reſt of his perfections and greatneſſe.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The ſecond, ſuppoſing that we cannot deſire God more good then he hath, becauſe in him are all good things, and his greatnes can be no more then it is, nor his glory more then he hath in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, but it may be greater exte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riorly
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:13110:49"/>in his creatures: and this is that which we deſire he ſhould haue.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. The third; ſuppoſing alſo that we cannot doe any workes that may be profitable vnto him, for he hath no need of vs, neither of all our goods can any profit come vnto him, but we may and ought to ſhew that we loue him in our workes fulfilling his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments: for our Sauiour him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe ſayth, he that hath my com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts &amp; keepeth them, this is he who loueth me; and ſo we muſt make many actes and firme purpoſes to fullfill perfectly the commandements of God, and not to breake any of them for all the world. And this ſame loue of God we muſt excerciſe in a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayne manner with the ſacred Humanity of Chriſt, which we
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:13110:49"/>haue great reaſon to loue more the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> al creatures, delighting much that God hath done ſo much good, and beſtowed ſo many fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uours of that ſacred Humanity, giuing him ſo much grace and ſo great glory, and ſo excellent ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues and dignityes, and deſiring that his name may be knowne, &amp; reuerenced throghout the whole world, &amp; propounding to fullfill faithfully al that he co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>deth vs, &amp; do him all the ſeruice we can.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. The fourth which follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth of this loue, when it is great and perfect, is conformity and reſignation, to conforme vs with all perfection we can to the will of God, loue what he loueth, ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horre what he abhorrethe, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire that in all things his will be done, as well in aduerſity and ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, as in proſperity &amp; ioy, as wel
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:13110:50"/>in this life as in the other, in time and eternity without any reſpect of our owne profit, guſt, or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modity, but only to the will of God, and that it be fullfilled; and in all things that ſhall happen or can happen, ſay from the bottom of our hart, Thy will be done in earth, as it is in heauen. This is the moſt perfect act of the loue of God, &amp; in which the ſoule ought to excerciſe it ſelfe much, and in this muſt ſpend the greateſt part of it excerciſe.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. And this affect of loue of God in the meditation of the my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteries of Chriſt is to be excerciſed conſidering the great and vnſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kable loue that he ſhewed vs in theſe myſteries, doing and ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring ſo much for vs, and with ſo great affection and loue, that it cannot be expreſſed. For there is
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:13110:50"/>nothing that forceth ſo much to loue another, as to ſee himſelfe lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued of him, eſpecially if the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon which loueth be of great dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity and nobility, and that he hath no need of me, nor hope for any profit of me, and I who am loued, am of vile and low condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and very vnworthy to be at all as I am.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. And ſo the Chriſtian muſt make with himſelfe this account when he conſidereth what God hath done for him, ſeing that all procedeth from loue: how God being who he is, loueth me ſo much, being ſo miſerable and vile a creature, and ſo worthy to be abhorred and deſpiſed of him; and only for the loue he beareth me, doth ſo much and ſuffereth ſo much, &amp; deſireth that I ſhould loue him; for how can it be ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:13110:51"/>that I loue him not, being he is goodnes it ſelfe, and beauty it ſelfe, and the depth of all goods: how can I leaue to loue one who hath done me ſo much good, and doth; and loueth me ſo much. And ſo it is reaſon to ſay with S. <hi>Iohn:</hi> Brethren, let vs loue God much, becauſe he firſt loued vs: and againe he ſaith, this is charity not that we loued God firſt, but that firſt he loued vs. Prayſed be he therfore of all his creatures. Amen.</p>

                  <p>THE affect of Imitation of Chriſt and his vertues, is the principall fruite which we are to drawe out of the conſideration of theſe myſteries, to procure to conforme our life with his, and direct all our workes in ſuch
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:13110:51"/>ſort as we vnderſtand to be moſt conformable, and like to thoſe of Chriſt. And this affect is excer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed in prayer in this manner, to conſider very particulerly &amp; lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurely the vertues of Chriſt our Lord which are diſcouered in the paſſage of his Life or Paſſion which is meditated, and to affect the will with loue of that vertue, and make very firme purpoſes to procure it, and to put in execution the neceſſary meanes for to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayne vnto it, and to excerciſe the actes in which it conſiſteth, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>formable to the condition and eſtate of the perſon who conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth it, and according to the occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions that are wont to offer them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues. Let is put an example in ſome vertues.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Conſidering the Humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of Chriſt, who being a Lord
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:13110:52"/>of ſo great Maieſty in as much as he was God, and as man, a King and general Lord of all the world, a perſon of ſo great dignity and veneration, he would ſo hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble himſelfe, and be vnknowne in the world, and be holden for an ordinary man, and ignorant; and being Sanctity it ſelfe would be accounted as a ſinner, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lefactour, and be condemned, and chaſtiſed for ſuch a one. Thus he muſt forme great deſires to be litle eſteemed, deſpiſed, and depreſſed, and purpoſe to procure it as much as he can, hiding all that he hath of honour, and eſtimation, and manifeſting his faults and all ſuch thing; as may humble him, as far as may be without ſcandal &amp; bad example; &amp; finally deſiring from his hart that all eſteeme him vile, and deſpiſed, and vnworthy of
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:13110:52"/>any honour, and truly iudging himſelfe for ſuch.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Conſidering the pouerty of Chriſt in all his life, and what want he had of thoſe things that were neceſſary for humane life, affect thy ſelfe much to pouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and make many purpoſes to procure it, depriuing thy ſelfe of all ſuperfluous things, and ſuch as be too much, and taking only thoſe that be neceſſary very mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate and ſcarcely, and haue no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing with affection, but the hart very free from all things.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Conſidering the patience of Chriſt in ſuffering ſo many ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſities, labours, and paynes, and his mildnes in ſuffering ſo many iniuries and abuſes without be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing angry with any body, neither wiſhing reuenge, but rather lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing very hartily thoſe who a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſed
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:13110:53"/>him and iniured him, and praying for them. To deſire much theſe vertues, and purpoſe to ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer with patience any labour, or aduerſity that may happen vnto him, or iniury that may be done to him, without abhoring or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing angry with any, nor deſire to be reuenged, but rather wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhing well to all.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Conſidering the Obedience of Chriſt, who without any obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation fullfilled ſo perfectly the Law of <hi>Moyſes,</hi> euen vnto the leaſt cerimony, and obayed the iudges although in iuſt and wicked, and euen the very Officers of Iuſtice, doing al that they co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>manded him not contradicting any; to make purpoſes to be very obedient to all his Superious, to fullfill (if he be Religious) very punctually all the ſtatutes, conſtitutions, and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinations
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:13110:53"/>of his Order, and doe moſt perfectly the will of all his ſuperiours, without co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tradicting or replying to any.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. Conſidering the Charity of Chriſt, who ſo much loued men, and did ſo much for them although vngratefull and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowne, without acception of perſons, as well to his enemies as frends; to propound with all effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacy to do good to all, as much as he can, although they be his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, and although it coſt him la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour; and the good he cannot do to deſire it from his hart, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire our Sauiour to giue them all ſuch things as they haue need of.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. And in this ſame ſort, let him do in all the reſt of the ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues of our Lord, which he ſhall confider and know, that it is of great importance, &amp; profit to vſe
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:13110:54"/>this excerciſe thus. For if theſe purpoſes be truly made indeed, with theſe deſires &amp; inward acts of vertues, our Sauiour receiueth them, as if they were done really indeed, and they diſpoſe the ſoule when occaſion ſhall be offered, to put them in execution: and in this manner the habit of ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues is gotten.</p>

                  <p>HEERE one thing of great importance muſt be parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culerly noted; that is, that theſe affects &amp; purpoſes of vertues, and deſires of the actes of them, we muſt not be content to do them in generall; but that they may be of more force &amp; efficacy we muſt particularize them, according to
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:13110:54"/>the condition of his perſon, and other particuler circumſtances, as putting example in ſome vertues.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Our Sauiour in his prayer giues him a deſire of Humility, and a purpoſe to procure thoſe things which may help him to be humble: he muſt not content himſelfe with this deſire ſo in generall, for this is of leſſe profit, but preſently he muſt come in particuler to conſider well, what can I do for this end, &amp; to ſee that this or that is wont to be an occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion that I haue my ſelfe in ſome account; the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> purpoſe to diſſemble it, and couer it: and this other may be occaſion for men to deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſe me, and haue me in leſſe ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count; then purpoſe to procure it, keeping in all the order that is conuenient not to giue ſcandall for bad example to any.

                  <p n="3">3. God giueth him a deſire to imitate the pouerty of Chriſt; he muſt not be content with ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king purpoſe ſo in generall, but to come preſently to the particuler and plot with himſelfe: Well I will viſit my chamber, and take away all that is ſuperfluous in it, and I wil remayne only with that which I cannot want or excuſe, yea and this I will diminiſh, that ſome thing may be wanting which may be too much.

                  <p n="4">4.

In fullfilling better my profeſſion, being more obedient to my Superiours, more obſeruant in all things of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, in giuing good example to my brethren, in performing thoſe things that obedience commands me which more diligence and deuotion, in louing my negh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours from my hart, in ſeruing them with great charity, and in procuring to giue them content
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:13110:56"/>in whatſoeuer I canne for Gods ſake, and propound to do all theſe things with conſtancy.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. God giueth him a deſire to go forward in vertue: ſee pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently: Well what is it that hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders me? And he ſhall find that ſelfe loue hindreth him, and too much affection to himſelfe, his ſlouth &amp; negligence in the exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe of vertue, his ſelfe will, not hauing mortified his ſenſes and appetits and many other thinges which eueryone in himſelfe will find by experience. Then to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound to amend al this and euery thing in particuler. And in the ſame faſhion he muſt make actes of all the reſt of the vertues, par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularizing of them according to his manner of proceeding, and marking all wayes the thing he hath moſt need of, to put there
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:13110:56"/>moſt force.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. But marke well that theſe particuler actes be not made ſo that they deuert him from his prayer, occupying his imaginatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in framing the things which he muſt do; or the perſons with whome he is to conuerſe. For in this there muſt be much regard, that in ſuch ſort he attend to that which is vertue, that he diſtract not his thought to things that be impertinent, and not to the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe: &amp; in this ſort this exerciſe is the moſt profitable that is done in prayer, for all prayer is ordayned to reforme bad cuſtoms, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect vertues, and this is not gotten with ſuch efficacie in the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall acts, as deſcending to the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticuler.</p>

The firſt circumſtance: <hi>VVho is he that ſuffereth?</hi> That it is Ieſus Chriſt, God and Man: in as much as he is God, he is the Eternall Word of his Father, ſecond perſon
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:13110:58"/>of the moſt B. Trinity, which created all things, and conſerues and gouernes them, and whome all ſerue, and obay. In as much as he is man, he is King and vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſall Lord of all that is created; to whome all creatures owe obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience and ſubiection. According to his body, he is conceiued by the holy Ghoſt, and ſo is the moſt beautifull and perfect of all men that God created, and the moſt delicate and ſenſible of all that euer were, or ſhalbe. According to his ſoule, he is full of grace, &amp; charity, and of all vertues, and giftes of the holy Ghoſt; full of meruailous ſcience &amp; wiſdome, by which he ſeeth and knoweth moſt perfectly euery thing that is, were, or ſhalbe; and that moſt holy ſoule is full of glory, and bleſſednes. Beſide this he is a great
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:13110:58"/>Prophet, a moſt holy man, who made ſuch excellent ſermons, and wrought ſuch great miracles, whome all people had in great veneration, and eſteeme.</item>
                     <item>2. The ſecond circumſtance: <hi>VVhat is that which he ſuffereth?</hi> That they were the greateſt torments, paynes, and griefs, that euer were ſuffered in the world: ioyned with moſt grieuous iniuries, ſcoffes and mockeries: and beſides that which he ſuffered outwar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dly, it was far more that he ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red inwardly in his ſoule, in the inferiour part of it. Firſt, for the repreſentation al the ſinnes of the world, particulerly thoſe of that people in putting him to death. Secondly, by reaſon of the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge he had, and the memory of all the ſoules that were to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned, and eſpecially of thoſe
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:13110:59"/>that be Chriſtians. Thirdly by reaſon of the liuely repreſentatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that he alwayes had of the griefs of his paſſion, by the which he al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes ſuffered them altogeather interiorly. Fourthly for the moſt bitter griefs, and panges which he ſaw his moſt holy Mother to ſuffer, the which he ſelt more then his owne: with theſe foure nayles he was crucified all his life, and tormented interiorly with them.</item>
                     <item>3. The third circumſtance: <hi>For whome doth he ſuffer?</hi> That is, for all men generally, as well enemies as friends, and for thoſe who are actually accuſing of him, tormen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting and killing him, and for thee thy ſelfe ſo in particuler, as if only for thee he ſuffered; which if it had been neceſſary he had charity inough, and more then inough,
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:13110:59"/>to ſuffer for thee only, and had thee ſo preſent in his memory, &amp; all thy ſinnes, as if for them only he had ſuffered, and ſuch deſire he had that thou mightſt profit thy ſelfe.</item>
                     <item>4. The fourth circumſtance: <hi>For what cauſe he ſuffereth?</hi> That is only for his owne goodnes and mercy, and his infinite Charity to deliuer men from great Euills, from which none but himſelfe could deliuer them, and to do them very much good, not ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing any need of his owne part, nor profit at all, but of his owne will and liberality. And of mans part the cauſe of his paſſion were all our ſinnes; theſe were they which did torment him, crucifie him, and bring him to death.</item>
                     <item>5. The fifth circumſtance: <hi>Of wome he ſuffereth?</hi> Firſt of his owne
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:13110:60"/>choſen people, of whome he was King, and naturall Lord, and whom he had honoured ſo much taking fleſh of their linage. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, of thoſe, to whome he had done ſo many and great benefits. Thirdly, of moſt cruell enemies, who did deadly hate &amp; abhor him. Fourthly, of moſt vile villaines, diſcourteous, without all kind of pitty, or good reſpect. Fifthly, of all kind of people, Gentils, Iewes, great and little, &amp; the very ſame that a little before had honoured him ſo much. Sixtly, of his owne Diſciples, for one ſold him, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other denied him, and all fleed from him; and euen his Mother with her preſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce did increaſe his torments and griefes, although without any fault of hers.</item>
                     <item>6. The ſixth circumſtance: <hi>How, or in what manner he ſuffereth?</hi>
                        <pb n="109" facs="tcp:13110:60"/>Firſt, with very great charity and loue of men, deſiring very inwar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dly that thoſe merits might be profitable vnto them, and being ready to ſuffer for them much more if it had beene neceſſary. Secondly, without any kind of comfort or conſolation, but for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaken of heauen &amp; earth. Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, with moſt profound humility, patience, manſuetude, ſilence, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience, fortitude, perſeuerance, mercy, pouerty, and deſpect of the world: and finally giuing them a moſt excellent example of all vertues.</item>
                     <item>7. To theſe ſix principall cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances, may be added two more. The one of the place where he ſuffered, to wit a Citty ſo po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulous, and religious, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the people where be had wrought ſo many miracles, and
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:13110:61"/>made ſo many ſermons, and recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued ſuch honour, &amp; in the mount Caluary which was a moſt infa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous and publike place of exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution for malefactours. The other circumſtance is, the tyme whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he ſuffereth; that is, at Eaſter for which had come to Hieruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem people from all parts of the world, and in the tyme when euery one thought of feaſting and reioycing.</item>

                  <p>THE firſt affect is of <hi>Compaſſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</hi> Conſidering that we ſee a perſon ſo noble, ſo venerable, ſo worthy to be ſerued, and reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renced,
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:13110:61"/>and ſo delicate, to ſuffer ſo many and great labours, ſo many diſcomodities all the ſpace of his life, and ſo great griefs, tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and abuſes in his paſſion, not only exteriorly in his body, but inwardly in his ſoule farre more, and that he ſuffer all with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out fault, for he neuer knew how to wrong any, but to do good to all, and that he is a perſon which commeth ſo neere vnto vs, and toucheth vs ſo neere, that he is more them our father, &amp; brother and friend, and that of his owne will he would ſubiect himſelfe to ſuffer that for vs.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The ſecond Affect is of <hi>Contrition.</hi> Conſidering that ſinne is ſo bad a thing, and ſo horrible, that for others ſinnes Almighty God did deliuer his only begotte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Sonne to ſuch cruell torments, &amp;
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:13110:62"/>that our ſinnes be the miniſters of Iuſtice which abuſe him, &amp; take away his life from him, and gaue him far more, then al the torme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts he ſuffereth.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. The third Affect is of <hi>Thanks<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giuing.</hi> Conſidering that by any paſſage of the life, or paſſion of Chriſt we are deliuered from ſin, and from al the loſſes that by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of ſin we had incurred, which are eternall death, the paynes of hell, the ſubiection and tyranny of all out enemies; and we are reſtored to the fauour and friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of God, and made his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren and members of Chriſt, and heyres of the kingdome of heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.

                  <p n="4">4. The fourth Affect is of <hi>Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration.</hi> Conſidering the perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of God, which are diſcou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, and knowne in the myſteries of Chriſt, the ineſtimable charity wherwith the Father Eternall loued men, that he gaue them his only begotten Sonne, and the ſonne himſelf, for he offered him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe to death for them; and al the Bleſſed Trinity, for it was occu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pied in this behalfe; the wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of God, that could find a remedy ſo conuenient to deliuer
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:13110:63"/>man, the dignity of the ſoules, the excellency of glory, the grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uouſnes of ſinne, the rigour of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine Iuſtice, the greatnes of his mercy: all theſe things are diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered in theſe myſteries, and all cauſe admiration when they be conſidered.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. The fifth Affect is of <hi>Ioy and ſpirituall Comfort.</hi> For although conſidering the toyles and payns of Chriſt our Lord, we muſt take compaſſion of him, &amp; feele them as our owne: on the other ſide we muſt reioyce much in the ſame things, not only in thoſe that be proſperous, ioyfull, and glorious which he wrought in the whole courſe of his life, from his nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uity till his aſcenſion, but alſo in the ſorrowfull, weariſome, and paynfull: firſt for the glory of God which reſulteth and ariſeth ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:13110:63"/>and the great ſeruice, and ſo pleaſing that is done vnto him. Secondly for the glory of the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity of Chriſt, for the excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent vertues that he ſhewed, and exerciſed, for the victory he gott of his enemies, and becauſe by thoſe labours, he deſerued great reward, honour, and exaltation that can be imagined. Thirdly for the great profit that theron enſued to all humane linage and mankind, and to all the Church, as well militant as triumphant: and ſo a man conſidering as a member of all this myſtical body, muſt reioyce and be glad at al the good of the whole body.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. The ſixt Affect is of <hi>Hope.</hi> For a Soule conſidering how much God doth for it, and the willingnes he ſheweth that it ſhould be ſaued, eſpecially hauing
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:13110:64"/>brought it to his Church, and made it partaker of al thoſe goods by means of faith and the ſacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; it muſt conceaue great hope of ſaluation, and that God will fulfill that which wanteth, and muſt it force it ſelfe to help, as much as in it lyeth, for this worke of it Saluation.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. The ſeauen Affect is <hi>Loue of God.</hi> Conſidering the vnſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kable loue that he ſheweth in do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing &amp; ſuffering ſo much for vs, it is iuſt that we ſhould be moued to loue him who loued vs ſo much: and this loue co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſiſteth: firſt inioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning al the goodnes &amp; perfections that God hath: ſecondly, in deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring that he may be knowne, lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, ſerued &amp; glorified of all crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures thirdly, in propoſing alſo on our part to ſerue him and pleaſe him in all we can, and conforme
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:13110:64"/>our ſelues in all things to his di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine will, as well in aduerſity as in proſperity, being glad that in all things his will be done.</p>

                  <list>
                     <item>1. FIRST to ponder very well the greatnes of a ſin: Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering the inſinite Maieſtie of God, and his perfections, and the iniury that is done him; how much he abhores it, how much he hath done, and doth to deſtroy it, the great rigour wherewith he chaſtiſeth it, the paynes of Hell and Purgatory, &amp; the great cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtiſments that he hath done ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tymes euen in this life.</item>
                     <item>2. Secondly the affect of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tritio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>; that is great deteſtation of all ſinnes, a great deſire neuer to haue committed them, although he ſhould haue ſuffered all the euills that in the world may be
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:13110:66"/>ſuffered, and make firme purpoſes not to ſinne, although he aduen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tureth his life, his Honour, and all that may be, and procure to extend this purpoſe to the veniall ſinnes, purpoſing to eſehew all that he vnderſtandeth to diſpleaſe God, how little ſo euer it be, coſt what it will.</item>
                     <item>3. Thirdly, feare to returne to ſinne, ſeeing that he cannot free himſelfe by his owne forces, and that allwayes the will is free, and may caſt away all the ſuccours of God: and although God help yet allwayes, he leaueth man in his liberty, to profit himſelfe, to receiue his fauours and helps or not; and from hence muſt grow to aske our Lord very affectuou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſly grace and fauour not to ſinne.</item>
                     <item>4. Fourthly, knowledge of himſelf. Seeing how vile and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hominable
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:13110:66"/>he is who hath com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted ſuch things, and how far out of reaſon it is to deſire to be honoured or eſteemed. And for this effect to conſider that perſons with whom he conuerſeth know all his ſinnes, as well as himſelfe, with all the circumſtances of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> and particularityes as they be; and if ſo they know him, how dare he lift vp his eyes, or appeare before them, or wiſh to be honoured or eſteemed. And to conſider that farre better God knowes them &amp; his Angells, of whom he ought to haue more ſhame; &amp; ſo walke allwayes with the ſpirit of humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity; and that this may be true, he muſt deſire from his harte that euery body ſhould know his ſinnes, &amp; ſhould deſpiſe him, and abhorre him for them, as he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ueth, and offer to our Sauiour
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:13110:67"/>with all his hart, that if it were his pleaſure he is prepared to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe them before all the world.</item>
                     <item>5. Fifthly, hatred of himſelf conſidering the great loſſes that ſinne cauſeth, and the good that it taketh from vs, and that final<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly it putteth a man in obligation to ſuffer for euer the paynes of hel. Marke how one would abhorre any other that ſhould haue done him ſo much harme, and put him in ſuch danger; and preſently let him well conſider, that he did himſelfe all that harme, and that none could haue done it, if he himſelfe of his owne will would not haue conſented vnto ſinne, in ſuch ſort, that he hath done more harme to himſelfe, then all the world could haue done him.</item>
                     <item>6. Sixthly, a purpoſe to doe pennance, taking vpon him the
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:13110:67"/>hand of God, and chaſtiſing in himſelfe the offences that he hath co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mitted againſt him, depriuing himſelfe voluntarily of the guſtes, and delightes that lawfully he might take, in payne of thoſe he hath taken vnlawfully and with offence of Allmighty God.</item>
                     <item>7. Seauenthly, knowledg of the bounty of God, and of his mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, &amp; of the loue he bare to men; for abhorring ſinne ſo much hath ſuffered them ſo long to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mit ſo many; and in the ſame tyme that he ſinned, he gaue him life, and conſerued him in it; and being his enemy and offending of him, he did not take from him this portion of natural benefits, of the light, of ſuſtenance, of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluences of heauen, and al the reſt: and not only theſe generall be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits, but did him others in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticuler.
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:13110:68"/>See, if a King would vſe this Nobility with one that had offended him; how much he would eſteeme him, and how much he deſerued to be beloued for it.</item>
                     <item>8. Eightly, thankes-giuing, for hauing ſuffered him ſo long in his ſinnes, and hauing giuen him ſo many inſpirations to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoid &amp; deteſt the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, &amp; inuited him with his friendſhip, and drawne him to his ſeruice, and done him other particuler benefits, deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring him from many dangers: let him looke how many may be in hell for leſſe ſinnes the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> his, &amp; that ſome or many of them might dye at the ſame time that he did of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend or ſinke in ſin, and make this account with himſelf, what haue I deſerued more then he, that he ſhould be now loſt for euer with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:13110:68"/>remedy, and I in the way to ſaue my ſoule, and with ſo good occaſions for it: particulerly let him conſider, that in the ſame tyme that he offended God, he gaue him inſpirations and deſires to be Religious, or ſuch like; in this ſort God pardoned him his ſinnes inſteed of caſting him into hell for them.</item>
                     <item>9. Ninthly, the affect of loue of God, gathering out of all that is ſaid how much he ought to loue God, who hath done him ſo much good, and deliuered him from ſo much euill, without deſeruing it: and in this laſt affect to detayne himſelfe long, and conclude with it, asking our Sauiour grace to be correſpondent to ſo great loue.</item>

                     <hi>§. II.</hi> In the conſideration of Death may be exerciſed theſe Affects following.</head>
                  <list>
                     <item>1. FIRST, feare of death; ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing how worthy it is to be feared becauſe of all terrible things it is the moſt terrible, and becauſe in it all accounts muſt be concluded, and receiue the Lotte of glory or payne eternall; and for many other reaſons, for which euen great Saintes did feare it much, and had it allwayes in their memory as a thing very im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant. And he muſt reprehend in himſelfe the careleſſnes that he hath of a thing that importeth ſo much, and purpoſe to haue it all<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes in his memorie to animate him to the ſeruice of God, and to bridle him from all ſinne. For this remedy Chriſt our Sauiour
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:13110:69"/>gaue vs warning, admoniſhing vs ſo ofte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that alwaies we ſhould be watchfull, <hi>becauſe we know not the day, nor the hower we ſhall be called in.</hi> And the holy Ghoſt doth admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh vs alſo in theſe words: <hi>In al thy works remember the laſt things, and thou shall neuer ſinne.</hi> In euery thing thou ſhalt meddle with, conſider if in the houre of death it would content thee, or diſpleaſe thee to haue done it, and with this thou wilt bridle thy ſelf from ſinning.</item>
                     <item>2. Secondly, knowledg of himſelfe ſeeing he is to come to end in duſt &amp; putrifaction, and muſtly in the hideous ſepulcher ſo abhominable, couered &amp; eaten with wormes.</item>
                     <item>3. Thirdly, deſpect of the world, and all things in it, to take away his affection from all creatures, ſeeing how little they
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:13110:70"/>can auayle him for that neceſſity, and to deſpiſe al pleaſures and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights, ſeeing that quickly they muſt end.</item>
                     <item>4. Fourthly, of pouerty, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſing all wordly things; for he ſeeth how poore his end ſhall be; and how that ſo much the more payne a man ſhall haue, by how much he hath liued in abundance of things; and more comfort, by how much the poorer he hath been.</item>
                     <item>5. Fifthly, to leaue off all ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluous cares of this life, and put all his care only in things that then may profit him, for only that is of importance, and all the reſt is to be laughed at; &amp; ſo paſſe though all the things of this life as by things of complement; make account that all that ſucceeds ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of proſperity or aduerſity, is
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:13110:70"/>to be langhed at, as a Comedy or a Maske; that thoſe that weep, weepe in teſte, and alſo thoſe that laugh, for preſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly it endeth.</item>
                     <item>6. Sixtly, comfort in al trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, and a courage to imbrace all difficulties which ſhall hapen of pennance, mortification, or the like, ſeeing it muſt end ſo quickly, and will giue ſo much comfort and confidence in the end. And all theſe affects muſt be ordayned (as to their end) to ſerue with more perfection our Lord; taking theſe meanes to bridle himſelfe from ſinne and to incourage him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe to all things that belong to vertue. Vnderſtanding, that it is very pleaſing to God the exerciſe of diſpoſing himſelfe to dye well: The death of Saints is precious in the ſight of God, and that it plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth him much to find vs then diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed,
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:13110:71"/>to carry vs preſently with him to his Kingdome. And ſo it is great ſeruice to him, that men put all their ſtudy and diligence in this exerciſe.</item>

                  <list>
                     <item>1. FIRST, to conceiue great feare of Iudgement, and therfore our Sauiour would ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie it by words ſo ſignifica<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>nt and fearfull, as we may ſee in the Holy Writte; and ſeeing how much holy men haue feared it, ſo growne in vertue, as <hi>Dauid, Iob, S. Hierome, S. Bernard,</hi> and other moſt holy men, who tie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bled to thinke of the day of Iudgment, and had it all wayes in their memory: and to this effect will ſerue to ſee the ſignes ſo terrible that ſhall go be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:13110:71"/>it, the being of Gods Iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments ſo ſeuere, the Iudge God himſelfe, in whoſe preſence the Angellsare not guiltles, and from whome nothing is hid, the Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence being inreuocable, not to called backe againe by any mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, and to be of glory, or payne eternall, and the ſame Iudge be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the part offended, &amp; ſo power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full that none can reſiſt him.</item>
                     <item>2. Secondly, great feare of of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fending God, ſeeing that he is to be Iudge in a cauſe of ſo great importance as ſaluation, or eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall damnation, no man in the world would be ſo inconſiderate and ſo voyd of ſenſe who would not take heed to offe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d a man that was to giue ſentence in a buiſines of his, of ſo great importance.</item>
                     <item>3. Thirdly, great deſire to pleaſe Chriſt, and do his will in
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:13110:72"/>all things, for we ſhall haue need of him, in tyme of ſo great neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity, and in a matter of ſo great importance: what diligence are men wont to vſe, to content a Iudge that is to giue ſentence in ſome buſines of their importance, and how many fauours do they ſeeke, and how many pleaſurs do they procure to do him, to haue him fauourable, and wel affected: therefore now we are in a time, where we may gayne the friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of Chriſt our Lord, and winne his will in doing him ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſeruices.</item>
                     <item>4. Fourthly, purpoſe to auoyd all ſinne, ſeeing that our account muſt be ſo rigorous, and ſo neere, that of an idle word he will aske account of it.</item>
                     <item>5. Fifthly, he very rigorous in examining and iudging his owne
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:13110:72"/>works: for this is the way to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe the rigour of the diuine iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as the Apoſtle ſaith: <hi>If we will iudge our ſelues, we shall not be iud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged of God;</hi> great comfort it will be to be able to ſay in Iudgment, <hi>I haue done Iudgment, and Iuſtice: giue me not ouer to myne enemies.</hi>

                     <hi>§. IIII.</hi> In the conſideration of the <hi>Paynes of Hell,</hi> theſe Affects may be exerciſed.</head>
                  <p>FIRST, knowledge of the fowlnes of ſinne, for God be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſo mercifull; and louing man ſo much, hath aprepared ſuch ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible torments for one mortal ſin: and from hence muſt ariſe a great hatred vnto ſinne, becauſe it is a thing that God ſo much abhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth, and by which he is ſo much
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:13110:73"/>offended, ſince with ſuch paynes he doth chaſtice it, &amp; from hence muſt ſpring another affect very pleaſing vnto God, which is to deſire rather to incurre all thoſe paynes, if it might be without offence, and without leauing to loue God, then to commit a ſinne, although I knew that no harme ſhould come vnto me for it, but that it ſhould be forgiuen me: for much more worthy is a ſinne to be abhorred, then all thoſe payns.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Secondly, to conceiue great feare of the paynes of Hell: and for this reaſon our Sauiour hath pleaſed to reueale them, as wel in the holy ſcripture, as in other par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiouler reuelatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, that we might help our ſelues by this feare, and with it refraine from ſinne.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Thirdly, a firme purpoſe to eſchew all ſin, not only thoſe
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:13110:74"/>that be mortall, and deſerue theſe paynes but euen yeniall ſinnes, that diſpoſe to theſe torments, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering that euery veniall ſinne, although it condemneth not to hell, yet it is a ſtepp that way, &amp; after many ſtepps where he ſhall leaſt thinke he ſhall find himſelfe very neere, and perhaps within; for he that maketh no account of litle things, commeth to fall into very great. And beſides this, they who are in Hell, are not puniſhed only for their mortall ſinnes, but alſo for their veniall ſinnes, and for euery one of them, with a particuler degree of payne; and it is ſo great, that if any of the dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned might chooſe, he would haue ſuffered, or ſuffer in this life very great torments for many yeares, to haue diminiſhed, or diminiſh that only degree of payne due to
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:13110:74"/>the leaſt veniall ſinne.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Fourthly, knowledge of the great rigour of the diuine Iuſtice for an idle word, a negligence, or not marking what he ſhould do in the ſeruice of God, muſt be ſo ſeuerely puniſhed, that by this he may learne to walke with a thouſand eyes in the ſeruice of God, endeauouring to eſchew any thing that may be a ſinne, nor ſo much, nor principally to fly from thoſe paynes, but ſeing it offendeth ſo much Almighty God, ſince ſo heauily he chaſtiſeth it.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Fifthly, he muſt draw from hence courage to deſpiſe all plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, and delightes of this life: ſeeing them to be but diſpoſitions for thoſe torme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts: He that feareth much an infirmity, and deſireth health, eaſily abſtayneth from the
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:13110:75"/>meate, that gaue him guſt, if he ſuſpect it will hurt him: then, Why ſhall not I refraine from all ſuch things, as are delightfull in this life, for they be thoſe, which engenoer idle humors, to fall into that eternall ſicknes &amp; infirmity.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. Sixthly, to get courage and force, to imbrace all the labors of pennance, and mortification; for by thoſe he deliuereth himſelfe from others far greater and vne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quall; patience, indifferency, and ſuffering in ſicknes, and all other aduerſity; and ſo this ſerueth to conſider all the differences of paynes, to apply them, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare to others like them, which are ſuffered in this life. When thou art in an ague, remember how different a thing it will be to ſtay thoſe ouens, and fornaces of Hell: when thou art afflicted
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:13110:75"/>with cold, what will it be to ſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d in thoſe lakes of froſt and ſnow: whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thy diſcipline ſmarteth, how much wil it greiue thee to be ſcor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged ſo cruelly, and ſo furiouſly by the Diuel in hell: &amp; ſo for ward in the reſt of the payns and labours, and in all of them thou muſt ſay with S. <hi>Auguſtine: O Lord chaſtiſe me heere, and ſcorge me with fire, with iron, and all kind of torments; ſo that thou deliuereſt me from eternall paynes.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="7">7. Seauenthly, gratitude that God hath deliuered thee from thoſe payns, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſidering &amp; making this account with thy ſelfe: What had become of me, if I had fallen into that depth, as I haue deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, and only the potent hand of God could deliuer me, being there be many others that deſerued it leſſethe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> my ſelf: look if thou wert in co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pany of other malefactours
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:13110:76"/>condemned to the gallies, or other terrible torments, and the King ſhould take thee from amongſt them, and receiue thee into his houſe, into ſome very honourable office, when thou ſhouldſt ſee the reſt rowing, ſcourged, pinched or ſuffering other torments, and ſhouldeſt conſider, that thou alſo wert condemned with them, and in their company, and only the clemency of God, caſting his eyes on thee, more then the reſt deliuered thee from this ill; with what eyes wouldeſt thou looke vpon him, &amp; what reaſon would there be that ſhouldeſt be grateful &amp; endeauour to giue him content in whatſoeuer poſſible thou coul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt: therfore when thou ſhalt be affrighted with the conſideratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of Hell, &amp; ſhalt ſee ſo many ſoules crying and houling with tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:13110:76"/>remember that thou alſo wenteſt theither, &amp; that the hand of God tooke thee out, without any deſert of thine, and put thee into his houſe with ſo honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable an office, as is to aſſiſt ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily in his preſence, occupied, and imployed in his prayſes.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. Eightly, the affect of the Loue of God hath great place in this conſideration; ſeeing how he hath dealt with thee, as a pious Father, for thou that dideſt go ſo madly to throw thy ſelfe into theſe paynes, his diuine maieſty ſought meanes and inuention to deliuer the from them, and tooke pitty of thy blindnes: and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though thou haſt reſiſted ſo many tymes his remedies, and haſt ſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen to returne backe vnto the dangers, he hath not beene wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried to keep thee from them, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:13110:77"/>he himſelfe was offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded: looke what Father would haue loued thee in ſuch ſort, and how much he deſerueth to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loued for this.</p>

                     <hi>§. V.</hi> In the conſideration of Glory, theſe Affects may be exerciſed.</head>
                  <p>FIRST, thanks-giuing for ha<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>uing created thee, to inioy ſo great good; for as much as tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth him, he created vs for it, and deſireth that al may inioy it, and is prepared and ready to giue it to al that wil: and ſo they who leaue to inioy theſe riches of Heauen, for their owne fault, they looſe them. Looke therfore now much thou oughtſt to loue, and be thankefull to God, who before thou wert borne bad built thoſe Royall Pallaces, and noble
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:13110:77"/>habitations for thee to dwell, and planted thoſe diuine walkes wherin thou mightſt recreate thy ſelfe: and prepared all thoſe kinds of delights and recreations that thou mightſt inioy them for all eternity.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Secondly, to ſtrengthen much the confidence of inioying them, grounded in the great bou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ty &amp; merey of God &amp; in the merits of Ieſus Chriſt our Lord; for thou knoweſt for this he created thee, redeemed thee, and brought thee to the Church, and hath done many other benefits for thee, and ſo thou oughtſt to ſay with great loue and confidence: I ſee well, o Lord, that I haue deſerued to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioy theſe treaſures of glory; but I truſt much in thy mercy, that I ſhall come vnto them, ſince for this, thou haſt created men, and
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:13110:78"/>redeemed me with thy bloud, &amp; haſt made me a member of thy Church, and deliuered me from ſo many dangers, and from ſo many tymes as I haue deſerued Hell, and done me infinite other fauours. I beleeue, o Lord, that thou haſt not done all this, that I ſhould periſh, but rather I truſt thou wilt end this worke, which thou haſt begun; and with this confidence, I hope to inioy theſe heauenly treaſures in the land of the Liuing.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Thirdly, ſtrengthen much the affect, and deſire to inioy that ſecurity, and with this ſay with the prophet: Bleſſed are they, o Lord, who dwell in thy houſe, for euer, and euer they ſhal prayſe thee. Like as the Hart deſireth the fountaynes of water; euen ſo my ſoule deſireth thee my God.
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:13110:78"/>One fauour I haue required of my Lord, and this I will aske alwais: that I may dwell in his houſe all the dayes of my life, and ſee his glory, and viſit his holy Temple. And marke that thoſe deſires muſt not be ſo much, becauſe it is for thy good in particuler, as becauſe thou knoweſt that our Lord is ſorued with it, and it is his will that all ſhould deſire, and inioy that good &amp; he is very well plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, that they ſhould procure it with great dlligence, and for this reaſon thou muſt deſire and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure it, and not for thyne owne profit.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Fourthly, to conceiud high and generous thoughts, and great contempt of all earthly things, an one that is in hope of ſo great wealth. If it ſhould happen, that the Prince, Heire of the kingdom <gap reason="missing" extent="2 pages">

                     <pb n="148" facs="tcp:13110:79"/>pines. And to pray hartily to our Sauiour for them, that he may conuert them, and that they looſe not ſo great a good.</p>
               </div>
               <div n="6" type="section">

                     <hi>§. VI.</hi> In the conſideration <hi>Of the diuine benefits</hi> theſe Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects may be exerciſed.</head>
                  <p>FIRST, gratitude which is an acknowledgment of hauing receiued all good things from God, as from the fountayne of them; and to remember them, and acknowledg them, &amp; prayſe him for them, and deſire that all creatures doe the like, and inuite them very affectuouſly that they would help thee to prayſe ſo good a Lord, as is declared more at large before.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Secondly, very firme pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes to ſerue our Lord and Saui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, and keep very perfectly his
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:13110:79"/>commandements, and his will. For in this manner only we may be gratefull vnto him for the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits he beſtoweth vpon vs. Litle would it auayle, that thou ſhoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt ſay to one that had done thee many fauours with great courte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſy, that thou thankeſt him, if on the other ſide thou beingable to do him groſt ſeruice, or giue him content in any thing though of ſmall importance, thou wouldeſt not do it. Wherfore true grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, and thanks giuing, doth conſiſt in ſeruing of our Lord, and willingnes to giue him con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tet in whatſoeuer he would haue of vs. Great ſhame it is to ſee the gratitude of brute beaſts, as the Oxe &amp; Aſſe, who for a litle ſtraw they receiue of their maiſters they ſerue them all their life, are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent that thoy loade them, and
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:13110:80"/>make them plow, and beare ſo many labours; &amp; other beaſtes al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though moſt fierce &amp; furious, they are made tame, and acknowledg thoſe that do them good: the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> with how much reaſon muſt our Lord complayne that men do not ſerue him, beſtowing ſo many benefits vpon them.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Thirdly, the affect of loue of God, for there is nothing more naturall, then to loue thoſe who do vs good, and ſo great good, not hauing deſerued, yea hauing de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merited it very much: for this effect it will help much to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider, that God beſtoweth all theſe benefits on thee, with great and exceeding loue, and with great deſire that thou profit thy ſelfe by them. And ſo the loue he beareth vs, is the firſt and princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall good of all that he hath done
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:13110:80"/>for vs: for all the reſt began in tyme, but the loue neuer began, but from all eternity he bare vs that loue which now he doth, as himſelfe witneſſeth by his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet; With perpetuall charity I haue loued thee. O how worthy a thing it is to loue much, who ſo much, and ſo long hath loued vs! Conſider the loue that a dogge, and other beaſts do beare to their maiſters, how they follow them whither ſoeuer they go, and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer part far from them, and being abſent, they (as it were) com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaine and howle, and ſeeke to find them, and ſhew great ioy when they find them, and the leal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty the keep with them. Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber this well, and be aſhamed, that a brute beaſt gets ſuch loue, &amp; keep ſuch lealty with one who giues him but a peace of bread,
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:13110:81"/>and thou doſt not get this loue towards him, that hath done thee ſo many and ſo great fauours, and doth euery day, he deſeruing ſo much to be beloued for himſelfe.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Fourthly, great hatred vnto thy ſinnes paſt; ſeeing that by them, thou haſt offended a Lord to whom thou haſt ſo many obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations to loue and ſorue; &amp; great purpoſes neuer more to offend him: for if it be ſo great an euill not to loue him, and ſerue him, how great will it be to offend him? The <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ogge, how fiere and cruell ſoeuer he be, if his maiſter come, he is tamed, and if he beate him he doth not dare to bite him: and there is no wild beaſt ſo ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uage, that doth offend thoſe that do them good. Remember thoſe words, that the Holy young man Ioſeph ſpake to his Miſtres that
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:13110:81"/>ſollicited him to ſin: my maiſter hath left all his goods in my hands, and knoweth not what he hath in his houſe, for all is in my power only thee excepted, who art his wife; then how is it poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble that I ſhould commit ſo great a fault, as to offend him. Looke with how great reaſon thou maiſt ſay, that our Lord hath put into thy hands al his goods, the heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s the earth, the ſunne, and moone, and all other creatures are made for thee, and euen the Angells he ſend to guard thee, to accompany and comfort thee, and aboue all, ſupernatural gifts, as grace, glory, the Sacraments, and our Lord <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 span">

                     </gap> giueth himſelfe to thee, and puts himſelfe in their power in the Bleſſed Sacrament; then with how great reaſon muſt thou anſwere to the Diuell: How
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:13110:82"/>ſhall I haue hands, or how can I offend him, who hath done me ſo much good?</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Fiftly, knowledge of the great bounty of God, and of his magnificence, and liberality, the which appeareth much in doing ſo great benefits to perſons ſo vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy, eſpecially thoſe he doth to them that offend him, and wil not heare his inſpirations; heere doth ſhine his patience, his man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuetude, his charity, thoſe father<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly bowels that he hath for all, &amp; many others proprieties and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſections of his.</p>
                  <p n="6">6.

               <p>IT is a thing moſt certaine, that a iuſt and vertuous man who is in the grace of God, in what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer degree of grace that he be,
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:13110:103"/>is moſt acceptable to the eyes of his diuine Maieſty. But if we do compare thoſe that ſerue God one with another, it is alſo manifeſt, that he who is diligent and fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uent in Gods ſeruice, and doth la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour to profit daily more &amp; more in the ſame, forcing himſelf to do that which he knoweth to be moſt gratefull to God, is by him more eſteemed and accompted of, then many others, who all-though they liue in his grace, haue no care of their going for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, but are content with this only, that they do not co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mit any mortall ſinne. We ſhall vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand this better by the example following.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Let vs imagine that a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine Noble Man hath in his houſe fifty ſeruants, and hath co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

                  <pb n="204" facs="tcp:13110:104"/>and fall out at words, &amp; although they do ſome things of thoſe that be commaunded, yet others they will not do.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The other Seruant deſirous to pleaſe and content his Maiſter in euery thing, and not to giue him any trouble or diſguſt at all, doth not ſteale any thing out of his houſe, be it neuer ſo little, is not ſo hardy as to tel him the leaſt vntruth, goeth with great ſpeed in whatſoeuer meſſage he is ſent, and if perchance he lingereth ſomewhat through forgetfull<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, remembring himſelfe he is ſory for it and doth amend it, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is he only careful to do what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer his maiſter hath co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, therby not to diſcontent nor diſpleaſe him, but he doth alſo endeauour to know ſuch things as moſt pleaſe him, &amp; to put them
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:13110:104"/>in execution, yea he would wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly vnderſtand euen his very thoughts, ſo to do ineuery thing that which might giue him moſt contentment.</p>
               <p n="5">5. By this example it is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt that this Noble man gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by right indgment and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, doth more eſteeme this one only ſeruant the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> al the other four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and nine, and that this one alone doth giue him more guſt and contentment then all the reſt: and that in things depending of his good will and fauour, he will do more for reſpect and loue of this one, then of all the others. Seeing then that all right reaſon is to be found in God, with emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nency and infinite perfection: this is alſo to be acknowledged in him. And the very ſame man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of proceding is vſed towards
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:13110:105"/>thoſe that in his Church do ſerue him.</p>
               <p n="6">6. All ſuch as liue in ſtate of grace, and will not looſe the ſame through mortall ſinne, but yet be retchles of their profit and going forward, are like vnto theſe ſeruants that will not commit any ſuch fault, for which their maiſter may put them to death, or make them ſlaues for euer in the Gallies; but for other things they neither be carefull to content him, nor fearefull to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſe him. Euen ſo theſe are ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly determined not to do any thing that may be mortall ſinne, for which they know God will depriue them of his grace &amp; glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry for all eternity, and caſt them into the torments of euerlaſting <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="207" facs="tcp:13110:105"/>which they vnderſtand, that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though God be offended by them, yet he will not condemne them more then to the paines of Purga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory; and ſo they care not to do many good workes very accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table to God, which they might do very well, and with great fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cility or little labour: neither do they care to follow ſundry good inſpirations that God doth giue them, nor to imbrace many god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly counſells which our Lord doth affoard the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, &amp; which they might very well accompliſh, according to their ſtate and calling. And al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit in committing thoſe faults which be not mortall ſinnes, they highly diſpleaſe and diſcontent Almighty God, yet they feele not the matter much, but rather do often paſſe their time in laughing at ſuch offences.</p>

He that liueth in the grace of God and procureth diligently his owne forwardnes, is like the the ſeruant who in althings doth endeauour to do faithfully what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer his Maiſter doth appoint, and al that which may beſt pleaſe him. Alſo this faithfull and dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent ſetuant doth his beſt, not only to eſchew thoſe ſinnes that be mortall, but euen thoſe that be veniall, by which he doth know &amp; ſee that God is offended; and if by forgetfullnes he do fall into any of them, he forth with conceyueth griefe and ſorrow thereof, and doth ſpedily amend them, and make accompt of the diuine inſpirations, by which God doth diſcouer vnto him his will and pleaſure, &amp; doth endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour to follow them, and doth greatly eſteeme of his holy coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="209" facs="tcp:13110:106"/>and doth fullfill many of them, as alſo many works of mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, and pennance, and humility, which he knoweth to be accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table to God: and although he be not bound to them by any pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept or commaundement, yet he doth them with a very good wil, therby to pleaſe and content his diuine Maieſty.</p>
               <p n="8">8. Of ſuch ſeruants God hath many in his Church, yet ſome better, and more forward then others: and he hauing regard to that which reaſon, and his Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall Law doth require, whence good Reaſon was deriued that moueth men to the like; he doth more eſteeme and account of this diligent, and aduanced perſon in his diuine ſcruice, then of a great number of others, that be ſlow and retchles: and of the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:13110:107"/>done by this one only, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaueth much more contentment and pleaſure, then of ſuch ſeruice as all the others do for him: nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is this to be meruailed at, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the ſeruant of God, that is diligent to profit, &amp; go forward, as he daily increaſeth in the grace and loue of God, ſo it falleth out oftentims that he alone hath more of his grace and loue, then a great number of them, who with ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gligence do ſerue him; hauing no regard to aduance themſelues in his loue. In this manner doth S. <hi>Gregory,</hi> and other holy fathers ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound that ſaying of Chriſt: <hi>I ſay vnto you, that eiten ſo there shall be ioy in heau<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </p>
               <p n="9">9. This is to be vnderſtood not for whatſoeuer ſinner; that is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerted,

Many alſo do expound the ſaid ſentence of any ſinner, whoſoeuer that is conuerted: and according to this expoſition, that greater ioy is not to be vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood of the eſſentiall and princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall ioy, which rifeth our of the eſtimation and loud of that thing wherein a man reioy<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

But expounding
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:13110:108"/>the ſame ſentence, as S. <hi>Gregory</hi> and other Saintes do vnderſtand it, not of whatſoeuer ſinner, but of him who returning to the ſtate of grace, beginneth to ſerue God with great feruour, and profit in his diuine ſeruice. In this ſort we muſt make compariſon of this ſeruent and inflamed pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitent, not with whatſoeuer per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, but with ſuch as remiſſely, and ſlackly do ſerue God.</p>
               <p n="10">10. And the meaning of Chriſt in that ſentence is, that God doth more eſteeme a ſeruant of his, that with diligence and feruour, doth ſerue him, although he haue byn alittle before a moſt grieuous ſinner, then ninty and nine iuſt, who with coldnes &amp; negligence of their owne profit, do paſſe their whole life.

Likewiſe it is a great proofe of this verity, to ſee the great accompt that God maketh of thoſe his ſeruants that go for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward in his ſeruice, and the great reſpect that he doth beare to them and the particuler care that he taketh of them: ſo that in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon of them, it ſeemeth that he little eſteemeth, and maketh ſmall accoumpt of thoſe, that ſerue him but negligently: for although it be certaine that God hath a peculiar and ſweet proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, and ſuch a fatherly and pittifull care of each one that doth ſerue him, and liue in his grace, as if in this wide world he had nothing els to doe, not whome to prouide for, nor ſaue, but him only; yet much more is the fatherly and friendly proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence and care which he hath of
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:13110:113"/>thoſe that be more diligent and forward in his ſeruice, to prouide for them, to honour them in ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall things, to protect and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend them, and to fulfill their harts deſires, and the requeſts that they do make him; that it may well be thought that theſe are his true friends, and deare beloued children. And it is ſo indeed, that albeital thoſe that be in his grace are his friends and children, yet theſe are his more eſpeciall and intrinſecall friends, and his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren moſt tender &amp; beſt beloued.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Let vs confirme this to be ſo by ſome examples. What a number of men were there a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the children of Iſrael, and in the whole world from <hi>Abraham</hi> till <hi>Moyſes</hi> (for the ſpace of foure hundred yeares and more) who liued, and died all in the grace of
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:13110:114"/>God, and yet he as it were for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getting of all the reſt, ſpeaking to <hi>Moyſes</hi> when he appeared vnto him in the deſert, ſaid, that he was called <hi>the God of Abraham, the God of Iſaac, and the God of Iacob;</hi> and warned him that he ſhould call him by this name before the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of <hi>Iſraël,</hi> &amp; affirmed that this ſhould alwayes be his Name, and that by this Name he would be knowen and named with perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall memorie in all generations. Kings are wont to take the title, and name of that Citty, which they do moſt eſteeme and moſt doth pleaſe them in al their king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome: and God is accuſtomed to call himſelfe the God of thoſe, whome eſpecially he taketh to be vnder his protection, defence and diuine prouidence. And ſo, for God to call himſelfe the God
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:13110:114"/>of <hi>Abraham,</hi> of <hi>Iſaac,</hi> and of <hi>Iacob,</hi> was to declare vnto the world how much he eſteemed &amp; made accompt of thoſe holy men, how much they had pleaſed him, and the ſpeciall care, that he tooke of them ſtill to do them good, and to performe the promiſes that he had made vnto them, and to all their offpring.</p>
               <p n="7">7. And he much more diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ncred how greatly he did reſpect and regard ech of theſe his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants, in that he named not him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe the God of all three togea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, but of euery one of them in particuler; for he ſaid not the God of <hi>Abraham, Iſaac,</hi> and <hi>Iacob,</hi> but the God of <hi>Abraham,</hi> the God of <hi>Iſaac,</hi> and the God of <hi>Iacob:</hi> and in that he was not content to manifeſt himſelfe by this name to <hi>Moyſes</hi> only in the deſert; but
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:13110:115"/>alſo would, and ordained that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt all the people, and in the whole world, they ſhould call him by this Name, and that with this title they ſhould call vpon him and praiſe him, and preach him, and that vnder this Name there ſhould be perpetuall memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry made of him, as who tooke it for honour, to haue ſuch ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants and friends, as were <hi>Abraham Iſaac,</hi> and <hi>Iacob,</hi> and was greatly contented and very particulerly pleaſed with them.</p>
               <p n="8">8. So farre doth arriue the great accompt, which God ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth that his ſeruant go forward in his ſeruice, and increaſe in all vertue: ſeeing that the reaſon for which God did aduance theſe three men with ſo great fauours and with ſuch honourable men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion aboue alothers of their time,
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:13110:115"/>is becauſe they were thoſe who in that age in which they liued, did ferue him with more forwardnes in vertue, and more perfectly ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fill his will, and were zealous of his honour and glory.</p>
               <p n="9">9. In <hi>Moyſes</hi> time there were many ſoules that liued in the grace of God, becauſe there was ſo great multitude of people whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they came out of <hi>Aegypt,</hi> that the men of twenty yeares and vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards were aboue ſix hundred thouſand, beſides women great and little, &amp; beſides men-children vnder twenty yeares of age, and beſides the <hi>Aegyptians</hi> as well men as women, who forſaking Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try did approach to the people of God, who were ſo many, that holy Scripture doth call them <hi>vulgus promiſcuum innumerabile,</hi> an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numerable multitude of ſundry
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:13110:116"/>ſorts of people. Now certaine it is, that amongſt ſo many thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands of faithfull ſoules, who had the Law and Sacraments of God, and who had ſeene with their eyes the wounderfull myracles wrought by God in their fauour, there were men and women in very great number, both of age and diſcretion, who liued in the grace of God, &amp; ſerued him with a conſcience pure and free from mortall ſinne.</p>
               <p n="10">10. And yet we ſee that of <hi>Moyſes</hi> alone, becauſe he was a man of ſo perfect vertue, that he was not content to fly that only which was mortall ſinne, but was moſt diligent to eſchew, what lay in him, euery leaſt offence of God, and to do whatſoeuer he knew might be acceptable to his diuine Maieſty, and was moſt
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:13110:116"/>mild in ſuffering the iniuries and moleſtations of the people, and of moſt feruent charity towards all men as well enemies as frinds: of this <hi>Moyſes</hi> alone, I ſay, for that he was ſuch and ſo good a man, we ſee that God made more rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>koning then of all the others that amongſt thoſe people liued in his grace. For when the people had ſinned and God would haue con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed them all, without hauing reſpect to the great number that amongſt them were innocent, or becauſe they had not yet the age to ſinne, or becauſe they had not conſented to the ſame ſinne, only for <hi>Moyſes</hi> ſake he did not deſtroy nor kill them all, and to him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone did he ſay, <hi>Dimitte me, vtiraſca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur ſuror meus contra eos, &amp; deleam eos.</hi> Let me alone that my fury may rage againſt them, and I may de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:13110:117"/>them. Who doth hold thee, o Lord, that thou doſt not kill them all? not ſo many innocents do withhold thee who neuer ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, nor ſo many Leuites zealous of thy honour, and only <hi>Moyſes</hi> with his prayers doth bind the hands of thine omnipotency, and doth ſuſpend the fury of thy iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, that thou conſume them not all. O how acceptable is it to God that his ſeruants daily go forward and profit in good life, ſeeing he doth make ſo great ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compt of one man, who is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect in vertue!</p>
               <p n="11">11. In time of <hi>Elias</hi> there were many ſeruants of God, whome amongſt ſo many others as were euill, our Lord himſelfe had kept in his ſeruice, through his diuine grace, as holy Scripture doth ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nify. And yet God had ſuch regard
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:13110:117"/>of <hi>Elias,</hi> that it ſeemeth he had in his hands the lawes of times, and the gouerment of the clowdes to dry vp the earth, and conſume the ſame with hunger, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he would haue it ſo, for chaſtiſement of the euill; and to ſend raine and make the earth fruitefull, when he mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued to mercy, did demaund it: in ſo much, that becauſe <hi>Elias</hi> was a man of ſo excellent vertue, it ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth God did beare more reſpect to him alone, then to all other iuſt perſons of that time.</p>
               <p n="12">12. Whileſt <hi>Dauid,</hi> and <hi>Salo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi> were liuing, when the people of <hi>Iſrael</hi> was ſo greatly dilated and multiplied, that, as <hi>Salomon</hi> ſaid ſpeaking with God, they were innumerable as the duſt of the earth, it is certaine that there was in the ſame, an exceeding great number of perſons who liued in
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:13110:118"/>grace and ſeruice of God. And for that <hi>Dauid</hi> had been a perfect ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uant of God, and bent alltogea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to his will, and ſought his glory with great zeale; and albeit he offended, yet touched of God, he roſe againe, purged with great pennance the former faults, and with much feruour recouered the grace he had loſt: for this, I ſay, as if God had wholy forgotten al the other ſeruants he had in that people, being offended with <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomou,</hi> and with them, and deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous to puniſh them for the great enormit yes they had committed, he ſaid to Salomon, <hi>Scindam Reg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num tuum, &amp; dabo illud ſeruo tuo &amp;c. I will rent thy Kingdome, and will giue it to thy ſeruant; notwithſtanding in thy dayes I will not do it, becauſe of</hi> Dauid <hi>thy father: Out of thy ſonnes hand will I rent it, nor will I take away all the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,

               <p n="13">13. And to King <hi>Ezechias</hi> who was ſicke and looking to die, he ſent to tell by the Prophet <hi>Iſay,</hi> as followeth, <hi>Ecce ſanauite &amp;c.

               <p>ALBEIT all iuſt men and ſeruants of God who liue in his grace do help the myſticall body of the Church, becauſe with their good works and prayers they obtayne ſpirituall fauours and gifts, by which ſinners are conuerted and iuſt men are main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained: yet men that haue gone forward and be perfect in vertue are in this reſpect of ſingular pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit and vtility. For although all iuſt men be liuing members of the Church, &amp; children of light, neuertheles thoſe other be as the eyes in a mans body, and as in
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:13110:120"/>this world the greater ſtarres of the firmament, and the ſunne &amp; moone that be as the eyes &amp; light of this corporall world.</p>
               <p n="2">2. So doth holy Scripture call them in ſundry places. S. <hi>Paul</hi> to the <hi>Philippians</hi> ſayth: <hi>In the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt of a crooked &amp; peruerſe generation, among whome you shine as lights in the world.</hi> And our Lord Ieſus Chriſt declared vnto S. <hi>Iohn,</hi> that the ſtarres which he held in his hand, were the Prelats and holy Doctors, whome there he doth call Angells of the Churches, for that theſe men of excellent vertue with their learning, and princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally with their example doe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waken and wonderfully animate all others to the loue of vertue. In ſo much that only one of theſe is able to conuert a whole Citty and Kingdome, &amp; keep the ſame
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:13110:120"/>in the feare of God, which the example of thoſe who be neither hoate nor could neuer doth: for although on the one ſide they eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chew all mortall ſinnes, yet on the other, if a man ſee them com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit of purpoſe ſuch things as are euidently ſinnes, but not mortall, and that they be careleſſe to do works of pennance and charity, they moue him very little to the loue of vertue. Wherfore to raiſe vp thoſe who are fallen into mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall ſinne there is neceſſary for the moſt part an example of great po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer and efficacy; and to inflame thoſe that be cold, is neceſſary an example that hath great adua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tage ouer them. And becauſe this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample is found in thoſe men who haue profited in vertue; hence it is, that they do ſo much moue their neighbours, and that God
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:13110:121"/>doth vſe them as fit inſtruments for ſo great works.</p>
               <p n="3">3. So doth S. <hi>Gregory</hi> ſay, that the examples of holy Fathers do help vs excedingly to the renoua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of ſpirit, becauſe by viewing and conſidering the workes of holy men, we be inflamed to the loue of vertue, and our hart doth caſt of her luke warmneſſe, prouo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked thereunto by the imitation of Saints. An excellent teſtimony of this truth, is that which holy Scripture doth recount in the Booke of <hi>Iudges.</hi> It is there ſet downe how the children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> did for long time after the death of <hi>Moyſes</hi> keep themſelues in the ſeruice of God, but at length did forſake and depart from the ſame; and the cauſe of this is ſaid to be, for that, whileſt there were a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the people auncient and
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:13110:121"/>graue men, zealous of the glory of God, who had ſeene the mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uails that God had wrought with the people, they were with the learning and example of theſe men kept in the feare of his di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine Maieſty; but theſe being once dead, the people forth with forſooke God, becauſe they wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted men renowned in vertue, who with their words and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples might maintaine and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcrue them.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Beſides this a worthy re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony of the ſame truth is that which holy Scripture doth ſet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore vs in the fourth booke of Kings, to wit, that when <hi>Ioas</hi> rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gned in Hieruſalem forty yeares, in the beginning therof he was a good King, and did walke vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rightly in the ſight of God, and all the people remained in the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:13110:122"/>of the true God, and it is ſaid that the cauſe of this their good was that there liued in Hieruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem a holy-Prieſt named <hi>Ioiada,</hi> who in his life time held with his doctrine and example both the King &amp; people in the ſcruice of God; but as ſoone as he was dead &amp; departed, the King ſwar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued from the truth, &amp; the people forſooke their God.</p>
               <p n="5">5. This is then that profit ſo admirable, that Gods good ſeruants do in the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon wealth and in the vniuerſall Church of the faithful. All iuſt perſons who liue in Gods grace although they haue but little vertue, are liuing ſtones of the Church of Chriſt, and do help the building of this houſe and ſpirituall Temple of God and the conſeruation of the ſame, as S. <hi>Peter</hi> telleth vs: but
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:13110:122"/>good men that goe forward in vertue are the pillars of this buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding which next after God they do beare vp and maintaine, and keep the ſame vnited with the corner ſtone and head of all the building, which is Chriſt the Captaine &amp; Prince of the whole Church, and ſo doth holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture name them.

               <p n="6">6. By this may be vnderſtood how much thoſe ſcruants of God
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:13110:123"/>do import in the Church, who are very diligent in their ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all forwardnes and profit. For as in a materiall building, when ſome pillars want, great part of the building falleth downe: ſo when there want theſe ſeruants of God that be f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ruent &amp; zealous of his glory, there is wont to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low great domage in the Church: as that in ſome citty, or kingdome either good manners be depraued and corrupted, and abuſes and vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces brought in, or faith be loſt, or the ſame Kingdome be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed and aboliſhed by Gods wrath, becauſe it hath no one to make reſiſtance againſt the ſame. Such daungers are accuſtomed to follow in Chriſtian Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>welths, and Kingdomes, when the forſaid men are not to be fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d. And for this our Lord God, who
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:13110:123"/>ſo much deſireth our good, when he is angry for the ſinnes of the people, and his iuſtice doth de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maund vengeance of them, doth wiſh and deſire that there were ſuch men to oppoſe themſelues a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt his anger, and for whoſe ſake he might not deſtroy the people that had offended him.</p>
               <p n="7">7. This to be ſo, is ſignified oftentimes by the Prophets: for when God by the Prophet <hi>Eze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiel</hi> had rehearſed the moſt grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uous offences with which the people had prouoked the fury of his iuſtice, declaring this his will and deſire, he ſaid: <hi>I haue ſought a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt them a man that might put a hedg betweene, and oppoſe himſelfe againnſt me for the land; that I should not deſtroy it, and I haue found none: I haue powred out mine indignation vpon them: in the fire of my wrath haue I conſumed them.</hi> Heere
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:13110:124"/>God doth not meane whatſoeuer good and iuſt man that was in his grace, for of ſuch it is certaine that there wanted not ſome in all the people of God; but he doth ſpeake of men of excellent ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, as S. <hi>Hierome</hi> doth explicate, becauſe theſe indeed are thoſe who with their praiers and god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly life do greatly reſiſt the anger of God, and thoſe who as pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars doe ſuſtaine and beare vp the people.</p>
               <p n="8">8. Another time God deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring to puniſh Hieruſalem, and to deliuer the Kingdome of Iury to the Chaldeans, to the end the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="247" facs="tcp:13110:124"/>the wayes of Heruſalem, and behold and conſider, and ſeeke in her ſtreetes, if yee can find a man dooing iudgment, and ſeeking truth, and I will be merciſull to her;</hi> as if he ſaid, Go vp &amp; downe with diligence thorough all the places and ſtreetes of Hieruſalem, and marke and inquire w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p n="9">9. O what great accompt doth God make of a man that goeth forward in vertue! O how
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:13110:125"/>acceptable a ſpectacle is he to his diuine ſight! when to find one ſuch man in the minds of innu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merable ſinners, who deſerue to be deſtroyed, he deſtroyeth them not; &amp; his iuſtice requiring that he forgiue them not, he doth yet for his reſpect pardon them, and ſuſpend the puniſhment which they deſerued. With great reaſon doth S. <hi>Hierome</hi> vpon the foreal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leged place of Scripture exclaime and ſay: Wonderfull is the loue that God doth beare to the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſnes and vertue of a iuſt man, ſeeing that not only for ten iuſt that were to be found in the Cit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, as in time paſt he ſpake to <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi> he would deliuer the ſame, but for one only ſuch, as he now demaundeth by <hi>Ieremie,</hi> if he be found in the Citty that he deſired to deſtroy, he would pardon the
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:13110:125"/>ſame.</p>
               <p n="10">10. Of this verity we find many examples in the Hiſtorie of Saints. In the time of that bleſled man Laurence Iuſtinian Patriarch of Venice, God was very angry againſt that Citty for the ſinnes that raigned therein. This holy man prayed for the Citty in which he was reſident, and the Venetians went to make warre againſt thoſe of Millan, at what time there dwelled in the yle of <hi>Corcyra</hi> a very principall Cittyzen of Venice, and neere vnto that place in an hermitage moſt auſtere, did make his aboad a certaine Hermit of great holy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, and endued with the ſpirit of Prophecy, who becauſe he dwelt ſo farre of, and kept him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe ſo ſecret, could not by any humane meanes came to the

               <p>ALTHOVGH for euery one to take at hart, and earneſtly imbrace this affaire of going for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward in Gods ſeruice, it ought to
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:13110:129"/>ſuffice, that this endeauour and diligence to increaſe in vertue, is ſo acceptable to God, and impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant to the Church: neuertheles becauſe it is expedient that ech perſon know what commodity himſelfe getteth by the ſame, we will declare in briefe, as well the profit that he doth receaue who is diligent in going forward, as alſo the domage that he doth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curre, who in this is careles and negligent.</p>
               <p n="2">2. To find the way to heauen it greatly importeth that a man know his ſinnes, and feele the grieuouſnes of them, and the oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions he hath to fall; and the ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations &amp; ſnares of our ſoules ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies. Now, God beſtoweth this ſo great a benefit vpon that man, who with carefulnes goeth for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward in vertue, for he giueth him
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:13110:129"/>the knowledg of theſe things. Before, when he liued retchlefly, and vſed no more diligence then to fly only ſuch ſinnes, as he held for heynous; although he knew thoſe ſinnes that be euident and manifeſt to all: yet many other things that be ſinns did not ſeeme ſo to him; others that were grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uous, ſeemed to him but light; and diuers things, which were great occaſions and temptations to ſinne, and a nourſery of many vices, he eſteemed not: neither did he ſee any daunger in them: and in the very ſame things which he knew to be grieuous ſinnes, he neither did feele, nor weigh the harme, and domage that lieth in them, nor what it is to offend the infinite maieſty of Almighty God.</p>
               <p n="3">3. But after that he hath bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken

               <p n="4">4. This is that which Holy Scripture doth ſignifie in theſe words: The way of the iuſt, as a light ſhining goeth forth, and groweth vnto perfect day. The
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:13110:130"/>meaning heerof is, that as the light of the day at the breake ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of is little, and as the day entreth more and more, ſo the light in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſeth vntil it commeth to that perfection which it hath euen at midday: ſo the life and conuerſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the iuſt at the beginning hath ſome little light to know what is euill and good; but as they go forward growing in ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, the light doth increaſe in them, euen vntill it arriue vnto that moſt bright day of Eternity, where God is manifeſtly ſeene in his owne light. This benefit that God beſtoweth vpon thoſe who go forward in his ſeruice, S. <hi>Iſidore</hi> confeſſeth in theſe words: The ſinnes, which to thoſe that begin to ſerue God do ſeeme light, to thoſe who go forwards in his ſeruice, do ſee me grieuous.</p>

                  <pb n="260" facs="tcp:13110:131"/> 5. And hence followeth that which the ſelfe ſame holy man a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoucheth, that thoſe who haue begun to profit in Gods ſeruice, do not only fly vaine oathes, but alſo ſimple lying: and thoſe that haue profited more, do not only fly lying, but alſo with very great care eſchew idle words. Thus much S. <hi>Iſidore.</hi> And that the deſire of going forward therby to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine to this knowledge more ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt of good and euill, which God doth communicate to thoſe that profit in his ſeruice, may the better be printed in vs, let vs conſider the words with which S. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> doth declare the ſame, in a certaine pſalme, ſetting before vs a man, who hauing led a ſinfull life is now conuerted, and begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth to ſerue God, and is ſo chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, that thoſe that ſee him, do
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:13110:131"/>wonder at it, and praiſe God, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. This man that before was of ſo euill late, how liueth he now ſo void of ſinne?</p>
               <p n="6">6. He addeth that this man albeit he leaue thoſe ſinns which he knoweth to be ſuch; yet he knoweth not, for the moſt part, the occaſions and danger of ſins, nor doth he auoid them, nor vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand many other ſins which he ought to eſchew: and if he go not for ward, he ſeeth them not: but profiting in vertue, through tribulations, he co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth to know them, and the more he profiteth the more he ſeeth the ſcandals and ſinnes of the people. And as he now beholdeth many euills, which before he did not ſee, he cryeth vnto God, ſaying: Woe vnto me, that my baniſhment is prolonged! And this he ſaith, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:13110:132"/>he deſireth to ſee himſelfe free from ſinne, and in compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of thoſe, that neither do, nor can ſinne at all.</p>
               <p n="7">7. Of this benefit which God doth beſtow vpon thoſe that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit in his ſeruice, there follow di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers other benefits which he doth offoard the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, &amp; diuine gifts which he doth impart vnto them: for as they grow in knowledg &amp; hatred of ſinnes, &amp; light of things apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayning to God, ſo do they grow in force and ſtrength to do good; &amp; as they go forward, God doth more increaſe the ſame in them: and he that in the beginning of a good life, becauſe he had little ſtrength to do well, did feele dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty and wearines, yea and great repugnance in many things belonging to vertue; when he hath gone forward, be findeth ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſines
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:13110:132"/>and ſweetnes in the ſelfe ſame workes, and in others alſo more difficult &amp; hard then thoſe; which commeth not of this, that there is any change in the good work it ſelfe, but of this that there is a changement in his hart, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe his forces and courage are increaſed to do all good.</p>
               <p n="8">8. This doth the Prophet <hi>Iſay</hi> affirme in theſe words; God is an euerlaſting Lord, who hath crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the bounds of the earth: he neither ſhall faint nor be weary, nor is there ſearching of his wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, who giueth ſtrength vnto him that is weary, &amp; vnto them that be not, he multiplieth force and courage. Young men ſhall faint and be weary, and young men ſhall fall in weaknes. But they that do truſt in our Lord ſhall chaunge ſtrength, they ſhall
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:13110:133"/>take wings as Eagles, they ſhall run and not be weary, they ſhall walke and not be faint; that is to ſay: God is our euerlaſting Lord, who hath created the limites of the earth, and in creating and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerning the world, he is not faint, nor wearied. And he hath this good property and condition that he giueth force to the fainty that they may worke, &amp; to thoſe that in this world be little, yea ſeeme to be nothing, he doth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe and multiply courage and ſtrength to do good.</p>
               <p n="9">9. And young men who be in the flower of their age, and ſtrong men who truſt in their owne forces, ſhall be faint and weary as weakelings; but thoſe that truſt in our Lord, which is to giue themſelues wholy and withall their hart to his ſeruice,
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:13110:133"/>hoping all good of his diuine mercy, theſe ſhal renew &amp; change ſtrength, and of weake and fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full ſhall become ſtrong and cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragious to all vertuous and good works. And as the eagle is renued by changing his feathers, and albeit he be of a heauy body, yet with his new feathers he ſoareth through the ayre with great li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ghtnes and ſwiftnes; ſo thoſe that do giue themſelues wholy to God, this new force which our Lord doth allot them, ſhall be renued and paſſe on in the way to heauen, without any faintnes, and ſhall runne in the ſame with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out being wearied.</p>
               <p n="10">10. This is the great fire of a generous mind which God doth giue to thoſe who profit in his ſeruice; he doth increaſe in them the taſt of ſpirituall things,
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:13110:134"/>the purenes &amp; ioy of a good con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, patience in trauails, effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacy in words &amp; good examples, dexterity and deſire the better to help our neighbours; he doth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe in them ſupernaturall aides &amp; fauours, he maketh them grow abundantly in his diuine grace and loue, and in other innume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable gifts and vertues, which grow with the grace and loue of God: becauſe, for a iuſt man to go forward in the ſeruice of God, is to vſe well the gifts and graces receaued at Gods hands, and to be indeed gratefull for the mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies and benefits of God; &amp; God hath giuen this his word, which he will not faile to obſerue, that he will increaſe his gifts to ſuch as vſe them well, and his graces and mercies to ſuch, as be thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full for them.</p>
               <p n="11">
                  <pb n="267" facs="tcp:13110:134"/> 11. This did our Lord ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie when he ſaid in a parable that a certaine noble man deliuered to his ſeruants ten Talents, and bid them traffique with them, that is to ſay, that God doth commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate and diſtribute his gifts to his faithfull ſeruants, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundeth to vſe them well and to the profit of their neighbours. And to him that had traffiqued well, gayning ten Talents with one that he had receaued, the noble man co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded to be giuen the one Talent of him who had gotten nothing with the ſame: which is to ſay, that God doth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe his diuine gifts, graces, &amp; mercies in thoſe that vſe them well, and do profit by them.</p>
               <p n="12">12. And ſo he doth confirme this, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cluding the parable with this myſterious ſentence: To him

               </head>
               <p>IT is the common ſentence of holy Fathers, that not to goe

Their mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning is, that of this omiſſion and careleſnes to go forward, it follo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weth that a man leaueth to doe many good works which he was bound to do, and committeth many faults which he was bound to eſchew, and ſo looſeth the fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour and deuotion of good life, and falleth to be cold and careles, and diſpoſeth himſelfe to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit offences, wherby he loſeth the grace of God, and indeed often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times doth commit ſuch faults, and vtterly vndo himſelfe.</p>
               <p n="2">2. This ſentence doth S. <hi>Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gory</hi> auouch in theſe words: Such as begin good works, and do not accompliſh them, are to be admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed, that with wary circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpection they conſider, becauſe
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:13110:136"/>whileſt they doe not performe their, good purpoſes, they diſanul euen thoſe things that were be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gon. For if that which ſeemed good to be done, do not grow and increaſe by diligent inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, euen that which was well done is diminiſhed &amp; decreaſed. And in this world the ſoule of man, like a ſhip ſtriuing againſt the ſtreame of a riuer that runneth downe, is not in any wiſe per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to ſtand ſtill in one place, becauſe it is driuen back and ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth downe, vnles it indeauour to go on forward. If then the ſtrong hand of him that worketh, do not lift vp to perfection the good works begonne, the ſelfe negligence of working doth fight againſt that which was wrought. Thus much S. <hi>Gregory</hi> By which words is eaſily vnderſtood, how
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:13110:136"/>greatly it importeth all thoſe that ſerue God, that they procure to go forwards and profit daily in vertue and goodnes.</p>
               <p n="3">3. But yet how neceſſary a thing this care of going forward is to all thoſe that ſerue God, and how aſſured the daunger is of tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning backe, and how diſpoſed thoſe be to vndo themſelues, who haue not this care, S. <hi>Bernard</hi> doth declare very cleerely, ſaying in this ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ner: We haue not heere a Citty of aboad; it is neceſſary that either thou mount vp, or go downe: if thou attempt to ſtand ſtill, it is impoſſible thou fall not. It is moſt certaine that he is not good, who is not willing to be better. And where once thou be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginneſt to loath to become bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, there alſo it is, that thou lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueſt to be good. And in another
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:13110:137"/>place he ſaith: So will I liue to my ſelfe, ſayſt thou, and remaine in that whereto I haue attained; neither doe I ſuffer to become worſe, nor deſire to become bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. Thou doſt then deſire that which at all cannot be. But if thou ſtand ſtill when Chriſt doth runne, thou doſt not approach neere to Chriſt, but doſt remoue thy ſelfe further from him, and thou oughteſt to feare that which <hi>Dauid</hi> ſaith: Behold thoſe that with-draw themſelues, o Lord, from thee, ſhall periſh. I here be S. <hi>Bernards</hi> words.</p>
               <p n="4">4. And although it be true, that not ſtraightway when one leaueth to profit in vertue, he lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth the goodnes he had to be ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous, nor the grace to be in Gods ſeruice; yet as we haue ſaid, he diſpoſeth himſelf to loſe the ſame,
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:13110:137"/>and to ſignify the great daunger in which he ſtandeth to looſe it, and how neere he is to fall. S. <hi>Ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nard</hi> ſaith, that not to go forward, is to ceaſe to be good, and that is to fall. And alſo he ſpeaketh in this manner, becauſe that negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence and careleſnes to go for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, although it be not in the very beginning a mortall ſinne, which taketh away all goodnes and grace, yet is it in part to leaue to be good, and it is a certaine kind of fall. This is that which holy Fathers do ſay of the great domage, that not going forward in vertue and the ſeruice of God, doth worke in him who hath be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gon to ſerue God, but yet goeth not forward.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Neither doth holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture leaue to tel vs the great daun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger in which theſe retchles men
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:13110:138"/>do liue, and how neere they be to fall, &amp; loſe whatſoeuer they haue gotten. In one place it ſaith: <hi>Qui mollis eſt &amp; diſſolut us in opere ſuo, frater eſt ſua opera diſſipantis:</hi> He that is ſlouthfull, and careleſſe in his worke, is the brother of him that ſcattereth abroad his works. The ſenſe wherof is, that he who pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiteth not in forwarding the good he begonne, and procuring to do with due diligence and perfectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the good works he taketh in hand, is like to one that deſtroieth all the good he had wrought. For as this man loſeth it wholy, ſo that other is in daunger and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition to loſe it. And in another place the ſame Scripture ſaith: Slouthfullnes bringeth ſleep, and a negligent ſoule ſhalbe fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed. That is, as S. <hi>Gregory</hi> doth well declare the ſame, that as
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:13110:138"/>ſlouth fullneſſe is cauſe why the body ſleepeth without neceſſity, and negligence in labouring is cauſe why a man indureth hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, and wanteth what is neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary for his ſuſtenance; ſo ſlack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and coldeneſſe in good life, and in going forward in Gods ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice, cometh to cauſe in our ſoule a ſpirituall ſleeping that maketh it as it were inſenſible for al good things, and want all ſpirituall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſts, comforts, and liuely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires of heauen, and ſuffer hunger of earthly conſolations.</p>
               <p n="6">6. This is another domage very great indeed, which the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gligence of a mans owne profit doth worke in the ſoule, for that it maketh it loſe all affection and comfort of heauen, and that now it taketh no pleaſure neither to thinke nor to ſpeake of God, nor

               <p n="4">4. And although it be ſo that
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:13110:142"/>holy men for theſe reaſons doe know their going forward, yet do they not therfore make more accoumpt of themſelues now, then they did in times paſt, but rather eſteeme themſelues leſſe, and more deſpiſe themſelues; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for this do they become care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe to go forward and profit, but rather daily do labour to go for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward more in the ſeruice of God. The reaſon of this is, becauſe whileſt holy and godly men do go forward &amp; profit more in ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, they receaue more &amp; greater light of God, with which they come to diſcouer in themſelues ſuch faults as before they knew not, &amp; come to feele much more the grieuouſnes of the ſame faults then they knew before.

And for this reſpect doth the ſelfe ſame holy man af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme, that God hath mercifully ordayned, that his Seruants of perfect vertue, againſt their will come to deale and conuerſe with their neighbours, who make them take charge of gouerne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, or other offices which bind them to this, that by profiting others through occaſions offered them, they come to diſcouer their owne defects, and ſo humble and contemne themſelues the more.</p>
               <p n="6">6. And ſo it commeth to paſſe with them, that whileſt they

               <p n="7">7. This is that S. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> would ſignify when he ſaid. He hath much profited in this life, who by profiting hath knowen now far he is from the perfection of righteouſnee. Hence it is that they ſo little accompt of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>temne themſelus ſo greatly, as if they were the duſt of the earth, as S. <hi>Gregory</hi> doth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe when he ſaith, That godly men the more they profit in the knowledge of God, the more they contemne themſelues, as if they were nothing, or almoſt nothing.

               <p n="8">8. Hence followeth a ſecond thing that the more they go for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, the more deſire they haue to go on ſtill, and they vſe more diligence in their profit, becauſe they know better the obligation they haue therto, and haue more force for the ſame, and for that they know how much God doth deſire their profit, and how much he is pleaſed therewith, and how much they wynne by going for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward. How will not that iuſt man labour to profit in Gods ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice, who with pure eyes of his ſoule doth know the infinit good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of God, and the mercyes he hath ſhewed him, and the loue he hath borne him?

<pb n="291" facs="tcp:13110:145"/>God, and that when he profiteth more, he doth more pleaſe and content him? How will not a ſeruant of God endeauour what poſſible he may to grow in vertue, hauing a cleare and vnpaſſionate iudgment to vnderſtand &amp; weigh how much one degree of Gods loue is worth, ſeeing it the price of God himſelfe, who is wonne with loue, and is poſſeſſed with change of loue?</p>
               <p n="9">9. And knowing that this loue is an infinit treaſure without taxe or meaſure, becauſe in the loue of God there is no meane, and that when he ſhall haue pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fited more in vertue, he doth grow ſo much more in this loue and gaine more of it, and ſo much the better ſhall be by grace and glory poſſeſſe and enioy God, who doth giue himſelf in change
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:13110:146"/>of loue. Eyes that ſee in this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, how will they not couet ſuch beauty? Hart that vnderſtandeth and feeleth in this ſort, how will it not burne in the deſire of ſo great good, as is gotten by going forward in the ſeruice of God?</p>
               <p n="10">10. Well did that holy King, and Prophet vnderſtand theſe gaines which be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tained in ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall profit, who ſaid: I ſaid, now haue I begun, <hi>this chaunge is of the righth and of the moſt high.</hi> After he had ſerued God many yeares, after he had well conſidered his miſeryes, and the cauſes he had to grow in his holy ſeruice; he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined with great courage and confidence to begin to ſerue him a new, renewing himſelfe alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geather with new feruour, and he confeſſed that this chaunge, to better and renew a good life,
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:13110:146"/>he had not of his owne ſtore, but of the mighty hand of God. And albeit he had ſerued God ſo long time, he affirmeth, that he now beginneth. For as that learned man <hi>Ambroſius Ansbertus</hi> ſaith vpon theſe words, The profit in vertue which thoſe men doe make who are choſen of God, is as it were a beginning to ſerue God: And euery day they are ſaid to begin, becauſe by moments of times they paſſe from ſome vertue to others.</p>
               <p n="11">11. The good ſouldiars that be in warre, and haue begun to fight, although the enemie come againſt them, and make reſiſtance and hurt them, if on their ſide they haue help to ouercome the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and hope to get rich ſpoiles, do not turne backe nor be diſmaied, but paſſe forward fighting with labour and daunger, vntill they

If then men doe this for ſo light hope of temporal things; how reaſonable is it that the ſeruants of God, who haue taken in hand, and begune the voiage of heauen, turne not backe for any contradictions or difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyes, nor be diſmayed, but go al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes forward, profiting fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue to vertue, ſeeing that on their ſide they haue Chriſt true God who giueth them ſtrength, &amp; the merites of his paſſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> wherin they may repoſe and haue confidence, and alſo beſides haue all the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wers

               <p n="12">12. It is reaſon that they ſhould learne of the Apoſtle S. <hi>Paul,</hi> who hauing laboured and meri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted ſo much in the ſeruice of God, and all that he had done ſeeming vnto him little in reſpect of that he deſired &amp; ought to haue done, he began a new to labour and merit, as he doth auouch in ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: Brethren, I do not account that I haue comprehended yet one thing, forgetting the things that are behind; but ſtretching forth my ſelfe to thoſe that are before, I purſue the marke to the price of the ſupreme vocation of God in Chriſt Ieſus.

               <p n="13">13. Theſe are the principall reaſons that perſwade and moue the harts of ſuch as ſerue God, as well of Nouices, as of thoſe that haue much profited, to force themſelues to goe daily forward and profit in his diuine ſeruice. Other reaſons there be like vnto theſe that do perſwade the ſame, which heare we will recount

And it is very reaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable, ſeeing we cannot yeald him this ſeruice and glory, for ſo much as we are not capable of infinite vertue, that at the leaſt we giue him all the ſeruice and glory, that we be able, confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mable to the forces which we haue receaued from the ſame God animating our ſelues daily to do him new ſeruices, and to giue him new glory with the increaſe

               <p n="14">14. The loue with which God doth loue vs, and hath loued vs euen from all eternity, is infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nit, becauſe it is his diuine eſſence it ſelfe; and it is a thing much grounded on reaſon, that, ſeeing we cannot now be correſpondent with infinit loue, that at the leaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe we put no meaſure to this loue, but goe daily increaſing in the ſame, with exerciſe of prayer and good works, which be the fiery coales with which the flame of goods loue is increaſed.

<pb n="305" facs="tcp:13110:152"/>ſeparat them from God, and that they turne vnto him, and to giue them the meanes that may fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther them to do this: Yet it is not a thing of leſſe neceſſity and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſit for the faith full, who are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerted, and haue begune to ſerue God, to animate them that they go forward in his ſeruice, and to giue them the meanes and aduiſes that may help them to this; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it would be of little profit that one had begun to ſerue God if ſoone after he returned to the vices which he left, or to others worſe then they: and, as we haue proued by holy Scripture and doctrine of Saints, thoſe that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing conuerted to grace, do not go forward in the ſeruice of God, are in manifeſt daunger to turne backe: and oftentimes it ſo falltth out that they fall againe to their
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:13110:153"/>ill life.</p>
               <p n="2">2. And albeit we confeſſe that ſome doe perſeuere in their coldneſſe, yet we haue ſeene moſt euidently that as well in reſpect of that which concerneth the glory of God, as of that which pertaineth to the good of the Church, a ſew ſeruants of God who go forward in his holy ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice do much more import then many that ſerue him with cold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and negligence. To the end then, that thoſe who haue begun to ſerue God may perſeuere in his grace, that ſo in the Church of Chriſt we may haue many of his ſeruants that haue profited in his diuine ſeruice, it is neceſſary, that in ſermons &amp; exhortations made to the people, there be oftentimes mention of thoſe things that help to this purpoſe.</p>
               <p n="3">
                  <pb n="307" facs="tcp:13110:153"/> 3. And becauſe among the hearers ſome there be that are not yet conuerted to a good life with a ſtedfaſt determination to ſerue God, there muſt be mentioned thoſe things which moue to leaue mortal ſinne, and to begin to ſerue God: and for that there be others who are reſolued in goodnes, and haue begun to ſerue God, it muſt be treated alſo very ſeriouſly of that which moueth to follow the counſels of Chriſt, as giuen by the euerlaſting wiſedome, and to do well thoſe works that be of co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maundement, to exerciſe men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall prayer, mortification, fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quenting of Sacraments, reading or deuout bookes, and to practiſe the vertues of humility, patience, charity, and others in their moſt high and perfect degree, and to fly the occaſions and daungers of
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:13110:154"/>ſinne; for ſo much as all theſe be meanes by which ſoules are main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in grace, and go forward ſtill in the ſeruice of God.</p>
               <p n="4">4. And ſpecially it is neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry that, that betreated and taught, which moueth to feare &amp; eſchew veniall ſinnes; for ſo much as a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt al the meanes which that man hath to keepe himſelfe in grace, and increaſe in the ſame, and in all vertue, who hath be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gune to ſerue God, this is very principall &amp; important, to cleauſe and purify the ſoule, as much as is poſſible, from veniall ſinnes which do weaken the ſame and diſpoſe it to mortall ſinne. And that which men ought to doe in ſermons, that ought they likewiſe to do in bookes which are writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten for the furthering of ſoules; that as there be ſome who of full
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:13110:154"/>intention and purpoſe do handle that doctrine which is neceſſary and very proper to drawe ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners from ill ſtate, and affectio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate them to vertue; ſo there be others that of ſet purpoſe treat of that doctrine which is neceſſary and conuenient for thoſe that haue begune to ſerue God, that they may keep themſelues and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe more and more in his di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine ſeruice.</p>
               <p n="5">5. This difference of doctrine neceſſary in the Church confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mable to the different diſpoſition of the faithfull, the Apoſtle S. <hi>Paul</hi> doth declare, when writing to the Hebrews he teacheth vs, that there be ſome faithfull who are little ones and young begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners in things pertaining to God, and haue need of milke, which is the doctrine that teacheth the
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:13110:155"/>beginninge of good life, which are to do pennance, to fly mort all ſinne, to receaue the Sacraments neceſſary for ſaluation, and that thoſe are not capable of the <hi>Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons of Iuſtice.</hi> Sermons of Iuſtice he calleth, as S. <hi>Anſelme</hi> doth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprete, the doctrine that is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenient for thoſe that be perfect; or as Cardinall <hi>Caietan</hi> doth ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound, that doctrine which trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth of going forward in vertue. And S. <hi>Paul</hi> ſayth that there be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers faithful in the Church who are men of perfect age, and haue need of ſtrong meate, that is, that learning which teacheth how a man muſt profit in vertue, and at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine to the perfection therof; and exhorteth and encourageth euery Chriſtian man to aſpire to this, by profiting in vertue and wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king in the perfection of charity.</p>
               <p n="6">
                  <pb n="311" facs="tcp:13110:155"/> 6. For euen as to little chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren they giue milke, not that this ſhould be their ordinary meate, but to ſuſtaine them there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with vntill they become able to eate ſtronger meate, with which they ſtill grow till they be perfect men: ſo likewiſe to the faithfull in the beginning of their conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they giue that doctrine which moucth them to the hatred of mortall ſinne; but after that they haue once begune to ſerue God, they muſt giue the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that doctrine which teacheth and animateth them to increaſe in all vertue.</p>
               <p n="7">7. And although it be a thing grieuous and difficult to per ſwade men with good doctrine that they forſake their ill life, and be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>uerted to God with all their hart; yet is it no leſſe grieuous nor leſſe difficult with doctrine
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:13110:156"/>&amp; aduiſes to perſwade thoſe who haue begune to ſerue God, that they go forward in his ſeruice: nay rather it is a thing of greater difficulty, becauſe one act of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trition, and one ſtedfaſt purpoſe neuer more to commit any mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall ſinne for ought that is in the world, which is conceaued in a moment, and of one word that is heard, is ſufficient to beginne to ſerue God: but to go forward and perſeuer, there needeth longer ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe in all vertues, and to fight longtime with ſtrength againſt vices, and paſſions, and tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the enemy. And ſo expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience doth teach, that of many who beginne to ſerue God few there be that go forward and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeuer in the good begun.</p>
               <p n="8">8. This doth S. <hi>Bernard</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe to be ſo in triall (and S. <hi>Bona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenture</hi>
                  <pb n="313" facs="tcp:13110:156"/>doth confitme it) in theſe words: More eaſily ſhall a man find many ſecular men to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerted to do well, then one reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious man to go forward from good to better. So much S. <hi>Bernard.</hi> Seeing then, that this affaire of going forward in Gods ſeruice, and maintaining a mans ſelfe in the ſame, is on one ſide a thing ſo neceſſary and profitable for the good of each one, and ſo impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant to the world, and on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſide a thing ſo difficult; it is neceſſary &amp; very conuenient that there be books written, which ſincerely, and of ſet purpoſe do handle theſe things: and that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt others, there may be ſome alſo in the vulgar tongue, we make offer of this, with deſire that it help ſomewhat to a thing of ſo great glory of God, and good

               <head>Of the fruit which thoſe, who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin to ſerue God, muſt reap of the doctrine that teacheth the going forward in ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, and the perfection therof. <hi>CHAP. VIII.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>IN the end of this Treatiſe it is conuenient to aduiſe a thing very neceſſary to be knowne for ſome that begin, or haue a will to ſerue God: and it is, that as of ſermons and bookes written to perſwade the faithſull, who as yet haue not begun to ſerue God truly, that they fly euery thing which is mortall ſinne, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine with themſelues not to do the ſame for any intereſt, or feare of the world; thoſe that now
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:13110:157"/>haue begun to ſerue God, and are reſolued not to offend him, muſt not be cold and ſlouth full, to content themſelues with this purpoſe, without paſſing forward to auoide other ſinnes although they be not mortall, and doing many good works very accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to God, abeit they be not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded vnder paine of eternall damnation, there by not to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curre the moſt grieuous dangers which follow of coldneſſe as we haue ſaid: So of Sermons and Bookes which teach &amp; perſwade the going forward in vertue and profit therof, thoſe that begin or haue a deſire to begin to ſerue God, are not to take diſcourage or diffidence, ſeeming to them ſelues that the way of vertue is difficile and hard, and that they cannot walke in the ſame, becauſe
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:13110:158"/>theſe things that do perſwade the going forward in vertue are not propounded to them with obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation of mortall ſinne, but with reward that they ſhall haue more purenes of ſoule, and ſhall more aſſure their ſaluation, and ſhall merit more grace &amp; glory before God, and ſhall enioy in this life the peace &amp; comfort which God giueth to the cleane of hart, and with reward of other innumera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble goods of price and value in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comparable, which God doth communicate to thoſe that do go forward in his diuine ſeruice, as we haue before explicated, and ſhall declare more heerafter, and therfore they are not by this to take diſcouragment or diffidence of their ſaluation.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That which they muſt ſelect out of this, is on the one ſide Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:13110:158"/>and Contempt of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, conſidering how ſarre off they be from doing al that which they ought in the ſeruice of God, and that which the ſupreme and diuine Maieſty doth deſerue and demaund, and reioyce with all their hart that God hath in his Church ſuch his ſeruants, who ſerue him with ſo great profit &amp; perfection, and giue him thanks that he hath giuen to thoſe ſuch a deſire and ſtrength: becauſe to be glad of the profit and perfection of others for the glory which heerof redoundeth to God, is in ſome part to be partaker of the profit and perfection of others.</p>
               <p n="3">3. On the other ſide, there muſt be great care had to put themſelues before God in prayer, and there to repreſent vnto him their weakenes and puſillanimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:13110:159"/>to requeſt him that he giue them a ſtrong and efficacious wil to go forward in his diuine ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice, &amp; then let them hope in the mercy of God, that if they perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uere demaunding in this manner, he will graunt them this gift; and the going forward in vertue, which now doth ſeem very hard vnto them and a mounting vp in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acceſſible, and that the only thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king therof doth breed diſcou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage in them, will come to ſeeme an eaſy and light thing: and by thinking that they be abſe euery day to go forward, and grow in a goodnes ſo vnſpeakeable as is the loue of God, they will receaue great comfort and ioy in their hart.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Let them conſider that this is not an affaire which is brought to paſſe with only natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:13110:159"/>force of man, but that the chiefeſt dooer of this worke muſt be Chriſt our Loid: and the moſt principall meanes which he doth vſe for this end is his diuine grace, which he of very good wil and with great liberality doth communicate and affoard to all thoſe that haue deſire to profit themſelues by the ſame; and with this grace things that be hard be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come eaſy; thoſe that be bitter be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come ſweet, and the heauy be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come very light. Let them conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der that in the Church of Chriſt there haue byn alwayes, and there be at this preſent innu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merable men and women of all ſtates, who haue profited much in the ſeruice of God, and be of perfect vertue, who, time was, did feele the ſame difficulties that they do feele; but hauing begun
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:13110:160"/>this courſe of ſpirituall profit, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping in Chriſt, and helping them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelue with his grace and fauour, they found it very plaine &amp; plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant to walke in.</p>
               <p n="5">5. And let ech one in parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culer conſider that which God hath wrought with him, and how in ſome things he hath chau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged him, and made him another man from that he was before; in time paſt he loued that which was ill, now he doth abhorre it; in time paſt he could not ſay as much as one prayer with repoſe and quietnes of mind, nor heare one maſſe nor ſermon with con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment, now he taketh pleaſure to pray with good will, and to be preſent at the diuine ſeruice and ſermons. Out of this then that God hath done with him without any merit of his, he muſt
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:13110:160"/>reape this knowledge and truſt, that ſeeing God hath chaunged him from quid to good, he being ſo farrt off from the ſame, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing ſo contrary deſites, becauſe he did giue conſent to his diuine inſpirations; he will like wiſe change him from good to better, if he wil vſe the gifts of his diuine grace.</p>
               <p n="6">6. This temptation of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement had S. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> in the beginning of his conuerſion, and with theſe co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſiderations did he ouercome the ſame. It ſeemed vnto him that it was a very hard thing to keep the purity of the Law Euangelicall, and particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerly to liue in perpetuall conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nency, and much miſtruſted that euer he could bring to effect ſo glorious an enterpriſe: and being in theſe feares &amp; diſmayes, he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:13110:161"/>to conſider with attention, that in the Church of Chriſt there were not only graue and ſtrong men of a moſt penitent life, who had attained to perfect vertue and did obſerue perpetuall chaſtity, as S. <hi>Anthony,</hi> and other his follo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wers, but that alſo there were many companies of young men and virgins, and auncient wid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowes, youthes and maids of ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der age who kept perpetuall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinency, and went in the way of Euangelicall perfection.</p>
               <p n="7">7. Thou maiſt alſo with the help of God be able to do that which theſe did: conſider that they did not theſe things relying vpon their forces, but vpon the power and grace of our Lord: caſt thy ſelfe then into his hands with ſecurity, and feare not that he will withdraw himſelfe to
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:13110:161"/>make thee fall, but be aſſured that with mercy he will receaue thee in his armes, and ſaue thee. He did likewiſe conſider the chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges that Chriſt had made, and did daily make in his Church, turning great ſinners into moſt holy men: and this thought did conſume his coldnes, and driue away the diſcouragment he had, and gaue him a great hart to go forward in vertue, hoping that God would do the like with him. So doth he confeſſe talking with God in theſe words: The ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples of thy ſeruants whome thou of blacke haſt made white, and of dead liuing, gathered into the boſome of my thought, did burne and conſume the heauy drowſines that I fell not downe, and did wonderfully inflame my hart. Theſe be the fruites which
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:13110:162"/>men of good vnderſtanding do reap of the doctrine that teacheth and perſwadeth the going for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards in vertue.</p>
               <p n="8">8. Thoſe to whome God hath imparted liuely deſires of their going forward, who are thoſe that haue great need of this doctrine, and of whome there be ſtill many in the Church of God, do reape of this to know with cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty and cleerenes wherin doth conſiſt the going forward and perfection of euery vertue, the meanes by which they muſt ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine it, and courage and reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution to practiſe it; and they reape great comfort conſidering the wonderfull good that is in euery vertue, and they reape re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies againſt temptations of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gligence, or coldnes, and wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons to reſiſt all the contrarietyes
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:13110:162"/>of vertues and their perfections, and light to know and eſchew all the deceites and fraudes, with which the Diuell goeth about to hinder the going forward of the faithfull in the ſeruice of God.</p>
               <p n="9">9. Thoſe that haue neither courage nor deſire to profit in ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue doe gather &amp; reape out of this doctrine humility and confuſion of themſelues, as we haue ſaid, which fruite is ſo excellent and ſo greata diſpoſition to all good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, that by the meanes of it God will giue them liuely deſires of their going forward, which yet they want. And to the end that by the reading of this booke they may gather fruites like vnto theſe, we demaund of the Chriſtian Reader, that ſetting aſide all cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rioſity, he read the ſame with de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to gather ſome profit for his
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:13110:163"/>ſoule, becauſe this booke is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded of Sentences of holy Scripture, and of holy Doctours of the Church: and that which of our part we haue added, is to put them togeather in order, and to accommodate them with more perſpicuity to the capacity of the Readers. And for ſo much as our Lord hath ſo great deſire of our ſpirituall profit, there is very great reaſon to grow, and hope well in his goodnes, that by ſuch meanes as theſe are he wil awake, in the harts of thoſe that with vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right intention ſhall read them, a deſire and care to go forward in his diuine ſeruice, to the greater honour and glory of his diuine Maieſty.</p>

                  <p>It is a ſorrow, that a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor hath of his ſinnes, which is not founded principally in the loue of God aboue all things, but in the feare of the paines of hell, or in the conſideration of the foulenes of ſinnes, or in ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the like thing: you now vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand the difference of Contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion &amp; Attrition, the Contrition
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:13110:165"/>is founded principally in the loue of God, and Attrition in the feare of hell, or in ſome other the like thing.</p>

                  <p>No: it is not ill, but good, and it is Gods gift, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſeth the ſoule to the purchaſing of grace, becauſe it goeth accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied with the hatred of ſinne, and with a purpoſe of amendme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t. But yet ſuch a ſorrow is not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect contrition, becauſe it hath not ſo perfect a foundation, as true Contrition requireth, and therfore ſuch ſorrow is called At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trition, or (which is the ſame) imperfect Contrition.</p>

                  <p>If one ſhould confeſſe himſelfe actually and Sacramen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally with Attrition alone, ſhould he obtaine pardon of his ſinnes, and ſhould he be put therby in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the grace of God againe?</p>

                  <p>Yea: for by the vertue of the Sacrament, the ſinner of attrite becommeth contrite: and therfore, among other reaſons, it importeth much to go often to Confeſſion, for as much as what Attrition ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not effect by it ſelfe, it effecteth by the vertue of the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament of Confeſſion.</p>

                  <p>Of that which you ſay, I conclude, that to obtaine the grace of God, it is inough for me to do the acts of Attrition, and for the reſt to haue a care to come ofte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to confeſſion: and therfore I will content me with it, without further troubling my ſelfe to do

                  <p>You ſhall doe well to confeſſe often, as they do alſo wel who do accuſtome to exerciſe the frequent acts of Contrition. For though a man by doing theſe acts of Contrition, may obtayne the grace of God, without going to confeſſion (though he muſt haue a purpoſe to do it, at leaſt when the precept byndeth him to go to confeſſion) yet in regard of the difficulty of hauing true contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and conſequently of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certitude that there alwayes is, as long as we are in this life, to know whether we be truly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trite or noe, a man muſt ioyne contrition with frequent confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, to be the better aſſured of that which importeth vs ſo much, as is the act of our ſaluation.

                  <p>I will doe it very wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly, &amp; the reaſon of that which I ſay, is manifeſt. For if by your owne miſcarriage you offend God mortally, you ſhall not haue your ghoſtly father alwayes at hand, to make your confeſſion vnto him preſently after, you haue ſinned. And it may further happen, that you ſhall not haue tyme to go to
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:13110:167"/>confeſſion: for you may dye vpon the ſodaine (ſith none knoweth what may befall him afterward) or you may by ſome ſecret Iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of God be take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> away with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Confeſſion.</p>
                  <p>And though you ſhould haue a commodity to confeſſe, this is the greateſt euill of all to continue an enemy of God (conſidering attrition alone, though it ſhould go accompanied with a purpoſe of confeſſion, maketh vs not his friends) and to looſe all the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal merit of all the good works, that you ſhall doe, from the time that you haue offended God, vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till the tyme you ſhall go to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion, and receyue his grace a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine.

Though it be certayne, that Attrition ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with the Sacrament of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion, be inough to obtayne Gods grace, yet this is not ſo cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine, as if it were an article of Faith (as it is an article of faith) that a man purchaſeth the grace of God by the meanes of Contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.

               <head>A briefe declaration touching Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trition, wherin be propoſed the reaſons, that ought to moue euery Chriſtian earneſtly to ſeek to make acts of Contrition, and to repent himſelfe of his ſinnes, at leaſt twice a day, in the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, and at night.</head>
               <p>THE firſt reaſon is, ſeeing the feare of God is the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of true Wiſedome, therfore the firſt effect that it worketh in a man, is to reconcile himſelfe to God, which is performed by Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trition. And ſo it is very fit, that this ſhould be the firſt, and prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall care and thought, that eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one ought euery day to haue.</p>
               <p>The ſecond reaſon is, for that all other deuotions, though they be good, holy, and commendable,
<pb n="347" facs="tcp:13110:173"/>yet needs muſt they be founded vpon Contrition; for as much as without it they ſerue not the turne before God, for the ſauing of our ſoules; whiles on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, Contrition alone is inough without them, when we cannot haue them. Wherfore euery one ought to a couſtome himſelf more to the vertue of Contrition, then to any other, ſeeing it importeth ſo much, and is ſo neceſſary.</p>
               <p>The third is, for that other deuotions are by an imprudency ſometymes recommended ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much, in ſuch ſort as the ſimple may be deceiued, being perſwaded that that is inough for them, and that they haue gayned all, when they exerciſe themſelues in ſuch deuotions. Whence it commeth that they take not any care about the reforming of their manners,
<pb n="348" facs="tcp:13110:174"/>and amending their life. And on the contrary, this deuotion of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſing the frequent acts of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trition and repentance, is ſo pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable and neceſſary, as it cannot be recommended inough. For when the ſoule is truly contrite, it cannot endure to entertayne any mortall ſinne within it, and it muſt needs be, that there is an a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendment of life in him, who goeth on, continuing in this exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe, to iterate the frequent acts of Contrition, and ſorrow for his ſinnes.</p>
               <p>The fourth is, for that, follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the doctrine of ſome very grane and learned Deuines, it is an opinion very likely, that at the houre of death euery one is bound by commaundement, not to ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy himſelfe with the hauing of Attrition alone, but be muſt fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="349" facs="tcp:13110:174"/>diſpoſe himſelfe to haue true and perfect Contrition; whence we will deduce the cauſes in the ſeauenth and eight reaſons. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore whoſoeuer is not accuſtomed to this, whiles he is in good health, he will find much diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuity to practiſe it at the tyme of ſo troubleſome a paſſage, that goeth accompanied with ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny paynes, griefs, cares and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhes of mind. Wherefore we muſt, whiles we are well diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed and in good health, encourage one another (with the help of God) euery day to exerciſe this art and trade, at the leaſt twiſe a day, when we riſe in the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, and at night when we go to bed: and more then that, to teach as many others, as we <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

And more then that, it ofte hapneth, that who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
<pb n="351" facs="tcp:13110:175"/>co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth to confeſſion, he hath not only no contrition at all, but alſo no true attrition neceſſary; or not (following the doctrine aforeſaid) is inough with the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament of attrite, to make him dontrite. Wherfore euery one ſeeth well, how neceſſary it is for him to endeauour euery day to make the ſeruent acts of Contrition. For peraduen ture euen with all this diligence there will be found many, who ſhall haue great diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuity to arriue to true Aitrition, and to that which is neceſſary with the Sacrament.</p>
               <p>The ſeauenth is, for that, though this comon doctrine (that fayth that the Sacrament maketh him who is but attrite, to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come contrite) be more then pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable, and ſpeaking morally, cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine alſo; yet it is not an article
<pb n="352" facs="tcp:13110:176"/>of fayth. And therfore in a buſy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes or ſo great conſequence, as is our Saluation, a man muſt not content himſelfe with this certi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, but he muſt ſecure his owne ſoules good with the help of God, as much as he can poſſibly, and that is, by doing an act of true and perfect contrition, by meanes wherof, and with purpoſe to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe, as hath been ſaid, this is a thing ſo certaine, as an article of fayth that he ſhall be ſaued.</p>
               <p>The eight is, for that though God our Sauiour hath a particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler and paternall prouidence in behalfe of his holy Sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts (&amp; eſpecially for thoſe that be alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether neceſſary) to the end there ſhould not ordinarily be any de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fault of the part of him who ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtreth them, which would be to the exceeding great preiu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice
<pb n="353" facs="tcp:13110:176"/>of him who ſhould receiue them: yet it cannot be denyed, but that ſomtymes there happen ſome defaults, and then the true contrition of the ſinner ſupply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth all the faults that happened, without any fault of his owne in the Sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, which faults could not be ſufficiently ſupplyed by any other thing, without Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trition.</p>
               <p>Thenin this, that, as it is gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by what hath been ſaid, there is nothing found in the world, that can (Contrition excepted) make vs certaine of our ſaluation: and on the contrary, (when all other things ſayled (ſo it ſhould be without our fault) it alone with a purpoſe and intention to go to confeſſion at the time requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, aſſureth vs ſufficiently of euerlaſting bliſſe. And by this it
<pb n="354" facs="tcp:13110:177"/>manifeſtly appeareth, that a man is not to haue any thing more in recommendation, then this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trition. And as it is the office of preachers, and of ghoſtly fathers, if we beleeue the Apoſtle, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concile ſoules to God; it is not to be doubted, but that their greateſt care ought to be to endeauour, that we euer haue in mind true and perfect contrition, conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring that by it we be immediatly, and inſtantly reconciled to God.</p>
               <p>The tenth is, for that ſeeing God doth the will of them who feare him; and that for the loue of ten iuſt perſons alone he had a will to pardon the Sodomits and Gomorrheans: certaine it is, that in teaching vs all this ſo holy and healthfull doctrine, and ſo ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable vnto good, and in exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſing vs in it, his diuine Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ieſty
<pb n="355" facs="tcp:13110:177"/>will withdraw his reuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging hand, &amp; the ſcourges which he threatneth vs for our ſinnes, and will fill vs with all the bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictions, that can poſſibly be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired, both temporall and ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall.</p>
               <p>The eleauenth is, for that to amend the life, to roote out the vices, to ſubdue the body &amp; bring it into ſubiection by mortificatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> and pennance, to goe on forward in the exerciſe of vertue, to ſuffer aduerſityes both patiently and cheerefully; frankly and with a noble mind to forgiue the iniu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryes done vs, to increaſe day by day in the loue of God and our neighbour, and in the knowledg that we owe vnto God in regard of his benefits, and to profit in the practiſe of the works of mercy, and to perſeuere till the end in the
<pb n="356" facs="tcp:13110:178"/>exerciſe of al ſorts of good works: to come to all this there is not to be found a ſpur more ſharp, or a more vehement incitation, then a ſpirit &amp; mind liuely, feruent, and continued with true and perfect contrition, which ſpirit and grace a man co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth to get by little and little, by accuſtoming himſelfe to the exerciſing theſe acts of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trition. And we alſo ſee on the contrary ſide, that many of them who ſeeme to haue profited wel, come after ſome yeares ſpent in the exerciſe of vertue, to fall ſo miſerably, as is euery day to be ſeen: which for the moſt part pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedeth of nothing, but that by little &amp; little by their negligence they loſe this ſpirit of Contrition and feare of God, and contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting and doing againſt the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaile of the holy Ghoſt, they
<pb n="357" facs="tcp:13110:178"/>will not feare and trouble them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues for their ſinnes already par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned them. And therfore euery one ſhall do exceeding well, to exerciſe, &amp; euery day often to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>new and reiterate this ſpirit, and theſe acts of true Contrition.</p>

               <p>IN the morning, Euery one muſt know the principall vice wherunto he is moſt of all incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned; ſeing that, that is it, which maketh ſoreſt warre vpon him, and moſt of all troubleth him. Hauing found it out, he muſt firſt giue God thanks for hauing pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerued him that night from euill, and miſhap, and then he muſt,
<pb n="358" facs="tcp:13110:179"/>vpon his knees exerciſe an act of contrition, which done he ſhall make in particuler this purpoſe, or the like, I deſire, o Lord, and I ſtedfaſtly purpoſe, and craue thy grace, that I may ſpend all my life in thy ſeruice, and that I would rather dye a thouſand tymes, then offend thee in anything, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue all, in this ſinne wherunto I am moſt of all propenſe, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined.</p>
               <p>At noone, he muſt be vpon his guard, and haue a care to execute and performe what he propoſed and purpoſed in the morning, and he muſt renew that his purpoſe as often as he poſſibly may. For example, when he heareth the clocke, at the beginning of any worke or action, when he goeth out of the houſe, or whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he is temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, or in daunger to be tempted

To be ſhort he muſt ſtryue and fight againſt the tentation vntill he go away with a glorious victory. If you fall ſometimes of frailty, be not ouer much afflicted or grieued for it, neither be you the more negligent therfore, but ſeeke in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly to riſe againe, and to ſtand vpon your feet, craue pradon of God, knock your ſelfe vpon your breaſt, or lay your hand vpon it, ſaying.

Giue my the grace to confeſſe my ſinnes, and that I may neuer offend thee any more. Euery time that a man falleth, he muſt do this, as I haue ſaid, and that in very good earneſt, and with a moſt harty affection; and he muſt continue the ſame cogitation and care, that he had, and propoſed to himſelfe in the morning, and greater if it may be, with an intent in all things not to offend the diuine Goodnes. And though all his care, and ſtudy ought to be not to fall into any ſinne; yet if it happen that he ſhould fall, he muſt not be negligent therfore, but he muſt endeauour eſtſoons to riſe againe, as he would do, if he ſhould often
